SAC2000 (Seismic Analysis Code for the third millennium) is a general purpose interactive program designed for the study of sequential signals, especially time-series data.


Emphasis has been placed on analysis tools used by research seismologists in the detailed study of seismic events.


Analysis capabilities include general arithmetic operations, Fourier transforms, three spectral estimation techniques, IIR and FIR filtering, signal stacking, decimation, interpolation, correlation, and seismic phase picking.
