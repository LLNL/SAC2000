SUMMARY:
Compute the convolution of a master signal with itself and 
one or more other signals.

SYNTAX:
CONVOLVE  {MASTER name|n},
{NUMBER n},{LENGTH ON|OFF|v},
{TYPE  RECTANGLE|HAMMING|HANNING|COSINE|TRIANGLE}

INPUT:
      MASTER name|n  :  Select master file in data file list by name or
          number.  All files will be correlated against this one.  

      NUMBER n  :  Set number of correlation windows to be used.  

      LENGTH {ON}  :  Turn fixed window length option on.  

      LENGTH OFF  :  Turn fixed window length option off.  

      LENGTH v  :  Turn fixed window length option on and change window
          length in seconds to v.  

      TYPE RECTANGLE  :  Apply a rectangle function to each window.  This is
          equivalent to applying no function to each window.  

      TYPE HAMMING  :  Apply a hamming function to each window.  

      TYPE HANNING  :  Apply a hanning function to each window.  

      TYPE COSINE  :  Apply a cosine function to each window.  

      TYPE TRIANGLE  :  Apply a triangle function to each window.

DEFAULT VALUES:
CONVOLVE MASTER 1 NUMBER 1 LENGTH OFF TYPE RECTANGLE

DESCRIPTION:
      The convolve command allows the user to convolve a master signal with 
itself and one or many other signals.  This command computes convolution, as
approximated by  cv(tau) = int ( f(t) g(tau - t) ) dt, where int means
summation over all time points with nonzero overlap.  There is no 1/N
normalization.  This is very similar to cross correlation which is defined by:
cc(tau) = int ( f(t) g(t + tau) ) dt.   Syntax and output are similar to that
of the CORRELATE command, except that the cross-correlation waveform is
replaced by the convolution waveform.
