SUMMARY:
Computes the envelope function using a Hilbert transform.

SYNTAX:
ENVELOPE

DESCRIPTION:
This command computes the envelope function of the data in memory.  The
envelope is defined by: where x(n) is the original signal and y(n) its
Hilbert transform (see HILBERT.) As with HILBERT, very long period data
should be decimated (see DECIMATE) prior to processing.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: The subroutines used to perform the Hilbert transform were
designed and developed by Dave Harris.
