Frequently Asked Questions


1)  Sometimes when I run SAC2000 and try to plot some data, the graphics 
    doesn't display.  All I get is an empty graphics window.

    -- Sometimes programs like netscape take hold of the color table etc ... 
    and don't allow SAC2000 to plot.  Turn off netscape or other applications 
    that hog the color table.  
    Alternatively, on many systems Netscape can be started up with the -install 
    option; this will let SAC2000 plot, but it will also make some funny colors 
    appear on your screen as you go in and out of Netscape.


2)  How do I get a shell variable into SAC2000?  

    -- You can create a temporary ascii file with a command like 
    setbb variable-name variable and run it as a macro.


3)  How can I reformat a variable with too many zero's?
    e.g.,
    getbb x
      x = 2.0000000e+00

    -- You can use the inline functions to select desired portions of the 
    variable you want.  See the string manipulation functions substring, 
    before, and after.

    For example,
    eval as f to x 2 * 1
    getbb
      x = 2.0000000e+00
    setbb y (substr 1 3 %x )
    getbb
      x = 2.0000000e+00
      y = 2.0


4)  Is there a way to convert SEG-2 files (real SEG-2 files, not SEG-Y) to
    sac data files?

    -- There is a code called seg2sac.  It lives at the Passcal facility at 
    L-DGO.


5)  Is there any way when producing a record section to have SSS line the 
    waveforms up on a particular phase arrival?  For example, if I use ppk  to
    pick the first arrival on each waveform and write that to the header, can 
    SSS line the traces up on the arrival?

    -- Use the changestack command as follows:
    changestack file# del &file#,pick_header_variable
    For example, changestack 1 del &1,t1 would shift the first waveform by the 
    t1 header value.


6)  SAC2000 is supposed to run UNIX commands, but it seems to ignore aliases.

    -- SAC2000 runs the korne shell when executing unix commands, not the 
    bourne shell which we usually use.  Unfortunately, it is not aware of
    our usual aliases.  


7)  SAC2000 is supposed to run UNIX commands, why doesn't rm work?

    -- The rm command was disabled because of concerns from some users that 
    they might accidentally type rm * instead of r m * or some other SAC2000 
    command.  You can use /bin/rm filenames if you like.


8)  I get an error message "Number 4003" with no explanation.

    -- Error 4003 is produced under the following conditions:
     - SAC2000 is trying to read an integer from an ASCII text file
       or convert a string of numeric characters to an integer.
     AND
     - The numeric string contains more than nine characters
       (in other words, the resultant integer would be greater than 
       1000000000 (1e+9) ).

9) How do I get SAC2000 to read binary data?

    -- The only binary files SAC2000 reads are in sac format.  If you plan to 
    read a file frequently it might be worth converting it to ascii, 
    reading it with readalpha and writing it out as a sac file with the 
    write command.

10) I need SAC2000 for a specific platform.  OR  I need the sac.a library
    for a specific platform.  

    -- We are happy to make SAC2000 and/or the sac.a library available to
    out collaborators.  If you are not a collaborator, and would like to be
    one, please print out the collaborative agreement form from our web site 
    http://ww-ep.es.llnl.gov/tvp/sac.html , sign it, and fax it to Peter
    Goldstein at (925) 423-4077.
    
    The latest versions of SAC2000 are available for Solaris, SunOS, SGI, and 
    Linux.  A Alpha version may be available someday.  

    Fortran libraries are available for Solaris, SunOS, and AIX.  A C library
    is available for Solaris, SunOS, SGI, and Linux.  

11) How do I read an ascii file into SAC2000?

    - If you have an asci file in column format 

    e.g., a file called "myfile"

    1.0 3.0 
    2.0 6.0
    3.0 9.0
    ...
    10.0 30.0 

    you could use the readalpha command in sac as follows: 

    ra content xy myfile

    - If you have a file in the sac alphanumeric format you 
    would use convert to comvert to sac binary format 

    e.g., convert from alpha myfile 

12) After using the cut command to change the lengths of waveforms, how do 
    I get them to begin at a specific time?

    - You can use the changehdr (ch) command.  Here are two examples:

    ch b 0
    ch allt 0

13) Why don't my flow control statements work in my c-shell?  

    - Flow control in sac was only designed to work in macros.  
    When you use flow control interactively or in a script, 
    SAC may not be able to find the end of the flow control 
    loop when its done processing statements in that loop.  

    For example, if you use an if statement interactively, 
    and the test is false, SAC will not know where to go 
    because there is no endif statement yet.  With a macro, 
    it knows to keep looking through the macro file.  
  
14) My Linux version of SAC2000 cannot read sac files written by the UNIX 
    version.

    - There is a special option in read and write called xdr. 
    It allows you to transfer unix files to linux.  
    Try the following: 

    a) read the data of interest on a machine on 
    a unix platform and write it to a new file 
    such as file.xdr.  
    b) copy this new file to the/ linux machine 
    and read with the xdr option.  

    e.g., 
    On unix 
    sac> read file
    sac> write xdr file.xdr

    on linux 
    sac> read xdr file.xdr 
    sac>write file

15) I cannot compile the independent programs contained in the utils and 
    demo directories.

    - The main utility program you should need is 
    sgftops. This should compile with any c compiler.

    - The routines written in FORTRAN are more challenging.  One option is
    to download the FORTRAN library and link to that.  Otherwize the fix
    is platform dependent.  Some FORTRAN compilers require calls to fucntions
    in C libraries to append an underscore (_) to the function name, and others
    don't.  SunOs and Solaris both require the underscore.  For this reason
    our FORTRAN utilities include the underscore.  SGI and Linux do not require
    the underscore, and for that reason, our FORTRAN utilities don't compile
    on those platforms yet.  We intend to write a wrapper, someday, that will
    make these utilities portable.  We don't know when it will happen.  

16) There is no sac/lib/ directory when unpacking the sac2000.linux.tar 
    file.

    - The sac.a library has recently been made available at our ftp site
      for those who have printed out a copy of out collaborative agreement
      (available on the web at http://ww-ep.es.llnl.gov/tvp/sac.html), signed
      it, and faxed it to Peter Goldstein at (925) 423-4077.

17) When I convert alphanumeric files produced on a VMS system
    through the command CONVERT, in binary SAC files on a SUN Solaris 3.5
    system, for some data files the program puts up the message
    WARNING: number 4003
    I haven't found in the manual any description of this warning 
    message, could you help me ?

    - You should be able to 
    1) use convert on the vax to generate an alphanumeric sac file
    2) copy this alphanumeric file to your sun
    3) use convert to read the alphanumeric file on your sun.

    The 4003 warning message indicates that SAC2000 tried to read a very 
    large integer ( > 1000000000 ) from ascii, and failed.  You may use
    a text editor to reduce the size of large integers if you feel you can
    do this in a way that perserves your data.  

18) In ppk, when I type 'l' it gives the response to three sig figs.  Is 
    there a way to get more sig figs/

    - If you make a pick (even just a temporary one) and then use the 
    listhdr command it will give more sig figs, but the time will be 
    relative to kzdate and kztime.

19) The ppk beeps all the time and is driving me nuts.  Is there some way to
    turn off the bell?

    - Yes, there is now a BELL OFF option on the ppk command.

20) I can't write files to a remote disk on a Solaris machine.

    - We have found that this is a nfs problem and it is fixable with 
    patches.

21) SAC won't start up properly for me.  
    I get a message that says something like:
    "Problems opening Command List: /usr/stuff/sac/misc/clstd"

    - You may need to set an environmental variable called SACAUX.  Do this
    with the setenv command.  Set it to the absolute path name of the aux 
    directory that came with sac.


22) The sac.a library is not linking.  There are a number of undefined
    symbols, most of which start with 'X'.  

    - The new sac library requires the -lX11 flag to appear in the link/
    compile line. 


23) The EVALUATE (or EVAL) command produces floating point values.  Is
    there a way for it to produce integer values?

    - Yes, use the AS option, eg.:
    eval as i to inumber ( 4 * 5 )


24) I have some extra integer information I'd like to store in the header.  
    Could I store it in the NXSIZE or NYSIZE header variables?  They don't
    seem to get used much.

    - Maybe,  NXSIZE and NYSIZE are used for spectral data, xyz data, and bbfk.
    I you will be using contouring, bbfk, xyz, or spectral functionallity of
    any sort, you should avoid using NXSIZE and NYSIZE.  However, if you know 
    that you won't be using any of this functionallity, you can use the command
    ch nxsize "integer_value"
    from within SAC, or
    setnhv('NXSIZE',nx,nerr)
    from your own program, where nx is the value you want to write to nxsize

    Do it at your own risk.


25) When I use wsac1() to over-write a SAC file, I get a segmentation fault.

    - If your code has the file name hardwired into the wsac1 call, try 
    changing it.  
        Instead of:
           wsac1('myfile.xyz', ... )
        try writing:
           fn = 'myfile.xyz' 
           wsac1(fn , ... )

26) I'm having problems linking with the sacio.a library.  What could cause 
    these difficulties?

    - If your object files (*.o) are out of date it could cause the problem.
    It may help to rebuild your whole program from the ground up.

    - In some cases, the sacio.a library requires linking to the math library.
    Try adding "-lm" to the link line if it is not already there.


27) Does the FFT in SAC depend on the length of the data window or the
    sample interval?

    - No, The fast fourier transform in SAC appoximates the continuous 
    time fourier transform.  As such, spectral amplitudes estimated with 
    SAC are independent of the length of the data window or the sampling 
    interval.  In other words, two unequal length windows that contain the 
    same signal will have the same fourier spectral amplitudes.  However, 
    the sample interval of the spectra are inversly proportional to the 
    length of the time series transformed.


28) Why is it that picks sometimes appear and/or disappear in my files, 
    seemingly without cause?

    - Data loaded into SAC is stored in parallel in two different data buffers.
    There is a SAC formatted data structure, and a CSS formated data structure.
    During processing, the data is transfered between the buffers without the
    user's knowledge.  Because the CSS arrival structure dynamically grows and
    shrinks as needed, and the SAC time markers T0 through T9 (aka Tn) do not,
    a conflict arrises when more than 10 picks are present in the CSS data 
    buffer.  This was initially solve by putting in place a preferences file
    to direct the flow of arrivals from the CSS buffer to the SAC buffer.  The
    preferences file is highly structured and sometimes missed important picks
    which did not fit into the structure.  This was addressed in version 0.59
    by allowing the user greater flexibility with the behavior of arrivals.  
    This added flexibility, when used without complete understanding, can make
    picks appear and disappear.  To understand how the picks are transfered 
    from the CSS data buffer to the SAC data buffer, use HELP PICKPREFS,
    HELP READCSS, HELP PICKAUTHOR, and HELP PICKPHASE.
