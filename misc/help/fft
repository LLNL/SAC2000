SUMMARY:
Performs a discrete Fourier transform.

SYNTAX:
FFT {WOMEAN|WMEAN},{RLIM|AMPH}

INPUT:
      WOMEAN  :  Remove mean before transform.  

      WMEAN  :  Leave mean in transform.  

      RLIM  :  Output should be in real-imaginary format.  

      AMPH  :  Output should be in amplitude-phase format.

ALTERNATE FORMS:
Purists may use DFT in place of FFT.

DEFAULT VALUES:
FFT WMEAN AMPH

DESCRIPTION:
Before the transform is performed, each data file is padded with zeros to the
next power of two.  SAC data files, on disk and in memory, can contain either
time-series data or spectral data.  The spectral data may be in either
amplitude-phase format or real-imaginary format.  The IFTYPE field in the
header tells you which kind of data is stored in a particular file and what
its format is.  Most commands work on only one type, either time-series or
spectal.  Certain commands such as FFT, IFFT, UNWRAP, etc. change data in 
memory from one data type or format to another.  See the Users Manual for more
information on SAC data types.  The spectral files that result from this
command can be plotted using the PLOTSP command or saved on disk with the
WRITE or WRITESP command.

HEADER CHANGES:
B, E, and DELTA are changed to the beginning, ending and sampling frequencies
of the transform respectively.  The original values of B, E, NPTS and DELTA
are saved as SB, SE, NSNPTS and SDELTA and are restored if an inverse
transform is done.

ERROR MESSAGES:
1301: No data files read in.

1306: Illegal operation on unevenly spaced file

1307: Illegal operation on spectral file

1606: Maximum allowable DFT is


LIMITATIONS:
The maximum transform is 65536 data points.
