SUMMARY:
Applies a Hilbert transform.

SYNTAX:
HILBERT

DESCRIPTION:
      Each data file, y(n), in the data file list is replaced by its Hilbert
transform, x(n). The transform is found by convolving y(n) (in the time
domain) with a 201 point FIR filter: The filter impulse response is obtained
by windowing an ideal Hilbert transformer impulse response with a Hamming
window: In the frequency domain, this filter approximates the transfer
function: The phase criterion is met exactly (90 degree phase shift at each
frequency), and the magnitude response (ideally unity) is shown on the next
page.
      Note that the operation is inexact in small regions about DC and the
folding frequency.  If transforms are to be taken of very low frequency data,
such as long period surface waves, the signals should first be decimated.
      Since the transformation is performed in the time domain, computations
are done in-place using the overlap-save algorithm.  There are no restrictions
on the length of data file.
