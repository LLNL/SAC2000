SUMMARY:
Interpolates evenly or unevenly spaced data to a new sampling rate.

SYNTAX:
INTERPOLATE {DELTA v},{EPSILON v},
{BEGIN v|OFF},{NPTS n|OFF}

INPUT:
      DELTA v  :  Set new sampling rate to v.  

      EPSILON v  :  Set interpolation convergence factor to v.  

      BEGIN v  :  Start interpolation at v.  This value becomes the begin time
          of the interpolated file.  

      BEGIN OFF  :  Start interpolation at begin time of uninterpolated file.
           

      NPTS n  :  Force the number of points in interpolated file to be n.  

      NPTS OFF  :  Let SAC calculate the number of points in interpolated
          file using the begin and end times and new sampling rate.

DEFAULT VALUES:
INTERPOLATE DELTA 0.025 EPSILON 0.0001 BEGIN OFF NPTS OFF

DESCRIPTION:
This command uses the Wiggins interpolation method (see reference) to convert
unevenly spaced data to evenly spaced data and to resample evenly spaced data
to a different sampling rate.

EXAMPLES:
Assume that FILEA is an unevenly spaced data file.  To convert it to an evenly
spaced file with a sampling interval of 0.01 seconds:
 
      u:  READ FILEA
 
      u:  INTERPOLATE DELTA 0.01
 
Assume that FILEB is an evenly spaced data file with a sampling interval of
0.025.  To convert it to a sampling rate of 0.02 seconds:
 
      u:  READ FILEB
 
      u:  INTERPOLATE DELTA 0.02
 
Assume that you want to force the interpolated file to have a sampling rate
of 0.005, to begin at time 18.237, and to have exactly 400 data points:
 
      u:  READ FILEC
 
      u:  INTERPOLATE DELTA 0.005 BEGIN 18.237 NPTS 400
 

WARNING MESSAGES:
2008: Requested begin time is less than files begin time. Output truncated.

- Requested begin time is less than file begin time. Output truncated.
2009: Requested end time is greater than files end time. Output truncated.

- Requested end time is greater than file end time. Output truncated.
