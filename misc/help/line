SUMMARY:
Controls the linestyle selection in plots.

SYNTAX:
LINE {ON|OFF|SOLID|DOTTED|n}
{INCREMENT {ON|OFF}},{LIST STANDARD|nlist}

INPUT:
      {ON}  :  Turn line drawing on.  Don't change linestyle.  

      OFF  :  Turn line drawing off.  

      SOLID  :  Change to solid linestyle and turn line drawing on.  

      DOTTED  :  Change to dotted linestyle and turn line drawing on.  

      n  :  Change to linestyle n and turn line drawing on.  A linestyle of 0
          is the same as turning turning line drawing off.  The number of
          linestyles varies from one graphics device to another.  

      INCREMENT {ON}  :  Increment linestyle from linestyle list after each
          data file is plotted.  

      INCREMENT OFF  :  Do not increment data linestyle.  

      LIST nlist  :  Change the content of the linestyle list.  Enter list of
          linestyle numbers.  

      LIST STANDARD  :  Change to the standard linestyle list.

DEFAULT VALUES:
LINE SOLID INCREMENT OFF LIST STANDARD

DESCRIPTION:
      This command controls the linestyle used when plotting data.  The
skeleton (axes, titles, etc.) are always plotted using solid lines.  Grid
linestyle is controlled by the GRID command.
      Not all graphics devices have more than the solid linestyle.  This
command obviously has no effect on those devices.  Also linestyle n may not be
the same from device to device.
      There are other commands that control other aspects of the data display.
The SYMBOL command can be used to display a set of scalable, centered symbols
at each data point.  The COLOR command controls color selection for color
graphics devices.  All of these attributes are independent of each other.  You
may select a blue dotted line with a symbol at each data point if you desire
      A linestyle of 0 is the same as turning turning line drawing off.  This
is useful in the LIST option and the SYMBOL command to display some data with
lines and some with symbols on the same plot.  See the example below.

EXAMPLES:
To select an incrementing linestyle starting with linestyle 1:
 
      u:  LINE 1 INCREMENT
 
To change the linestyle list to contain linestyles 3, 5, and 1:
 
      u:  LINE LIST 3 5 1
 
To plot three files on the same plot using PLOT2 with the first file plotted
using a solid line and no symbol, the second with no line and a triangle
symbol, and the third with no line and a cross symbol:
 
      u:  READ FILE1 FILE2 FILE3
 
      u:  LINE LIST 1 0 0 INCREMENT
 
      u:  SYMBOL LIST 0 3 7 INCREMENT
 
      u:  PLOT2
