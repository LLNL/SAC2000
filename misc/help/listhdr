SUMMARY:
Lists the values of selected header fields.

SYNTAX:
LISTHDR {listops} {hdrlist}
where listops are one or more of the following:
 
DEFAULT|PICKS|SPECIAL
FILES ALL|list
COLUMNS 1|2
INCLUSIVE ON|OFF
 

INPUT:
      DEFAULT  :  Use the default list, which includes all defined header
          fields.  

      PICKS  :  Use the picks list, which includes those header fields used to
           define time picks.  

      SPECIAL  :  Use the special user defined list.  

      FILES ALL  :  List headers from all files in data file list.  

      FILES list  :  List headers from a subset of the files in the data file
          list.  The subset is defined as a list of file numbers.  

      COLUMNS 1  :  Format output into a single column of entries.  

      COLUMNS 2  :  Format output into two columns.  

      INCLUSIVE  :  ON includes header variables which are undefined.
                    OFF excludes them.

      hdrlist  :  List of header fields to be included in the special list.

DEFAULT VALUES:
LISTHDR DEFAULT FILES ALL COLUMNS 1 INCLUSIVE OFF

DESCRIPTION:
      The user can define which items to list or can use either of two 
standard lists.  The first list (DEFAULT) contains all of the header
fields.  The second list (PICKS) contains those header fields which are
directly or indirectly used to define time picks.  This list contains the
following fields: B, E, O, A, Tn, KZTIME, KZDATE.  More standard lists can be
added if needed.  A special list can be defined by the user at any time and
can then be requested again by using the SPECIAL option.
      The full listing for a header field consists of its name, an equals 
sign, and its current value.  Some of the fields for some files will be
undefined.  SAC stores a special value in those fields to flag them as
undefined.  The listing excludes these undefined fields unless the INCLUSIVE
option is ON.  For integers and floats the undefined value is -12345; for 
character strings and those integers which are used to indicate character 
strings, the undefined value it "UNDEFINED".  

      A description of each of the SAC header fields is contained in an 
appendix to this manual.

ERROR MESSAGES:
1301: No data files read in.


EXAMPLES:
To get a two column listing of the time picks only:
 
      u:  LISTHDR PICKS COLUMNS 2
 
To get a default listing of the third and fourth files in the data file list:
 
      u:  LISTHDR FILES 3 4
 
To list the values of the begin and end time only:
 
      u:  LISTHDR B E
 
To define a special list of the station parameters:
 
      u:  LISTHDR KSTNM STLA STLO STEL STDP
 
To reuse this special list later during the same execution:
 
      u:  LISTHDR SPECIAL
