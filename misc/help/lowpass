SUMMARY:
Applies an IIR lowpass filter.

SYNTAX:
LOWPASS {BUTTER|BESSEL|C1|C2},{CORNER v},
{NPOLES n},{PASSES n},{TRANBW v},{ATTEN v}

INPUT:
      BUTTER  :  Apply a Butterworth filter.  

      BESSEL  :  Apply a Bessel filter.  

      C1  :  Apply a Chebyshev Type I filter.  

      C2  :  Apply a Chebyshev Type II filter.  

      CORNER v  :  Set corner frequency to v.  

      NPOLES n  :  Set number of poles to n {range: 1-10}.  

      PASSES n  :  Set number of passes to n {range: 1-2}.  

      TRANBW v  :  Set the Chebyshev transition band width to v.  

      ATTEN v  :  Set the Chebyshev attenuation factor to v.

DEFAULT VALUES:
LOWPASS BUTTER CORNER 0.4 NPOLES 2 PASSES 1 TRANBW 0.3 ATTEN 30.

DESCRIPTION:
See the BANDPASS command for definitions of the filter parameters and
descriptions on how to use them.

EXAMPLES:
To apply a four-pole Butterworth with a corner at 2 Hz.
 
      u:  LOWPASS NPOLES 4 CORNER 2
 
To apply a two-pole two-pass Bessel with the same corner.
 
      u:  LP N 2 BE P 2
 

ERROR MESSAGES:
1301: No data files read in.

1306: Illegal operation on unevenly spaced file

1307: Illegal operation on spectral file

1002: Bad value for

- corner frequency larger than Nyquist frequency.  See Chapter 4 of Rabiner
and Gold, Theory and Application of Digital Signal Processing, Prentice-Hall,
1975 for a discussion of IIR filters.
