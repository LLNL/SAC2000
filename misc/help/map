
SAC Command Reference Manual                                      MAP

SUMMARY:
Generate a GMT (Generic Mapping Tools) map with station/event
symbols topography and station names using all the files in SAC memory
and an optional event file specified on the command line.  Event symbols
can be scaled according to magnitude, residual, etc...
A variety of projections are available.

The results of this command will automatically be displayed using the
users default postscript display tool provided they have set the
SACPSVIEWER environmental variable,  e.g.,

setenv SACPSVIEWER "ghostview -magstep -4"


SYNTAX:
MAP   {MERcator | EQuidistant | AZimuthal_equidistant | ROBinson }
      {WEST minlon} {EAST maxlon} {NORTH maxlat} {SOUTH minlat}
      {MAGnitude | REsidual | RMean_residual}
      {EVentfile filename} {TOPOgraphy} {STAnames}

* Shorthand notations for keywords are in capital letters with
the optional remaining letters in lowercase.

INPUT OPTIONS:

      MERCATOR:    Generate a Mercator projection. (Default)
      EQUIDISTANT: Generate an Equidistant cylindrical projection.
	           Linear in lat and lon.
      AZIMUTHAL_EQUIDISTANT: Distances from center are true.
      ROBINSON:    Robinson projection, nice for world map.
      LAMBERT:     Good for large east-west areas.
#      UTM:         Universal transverse mercator. (unimplemented)

The following options allow the user to specify the map region.
The default is to use the min and max defined by the stations
and events.
      WEST:        Define minimum longitude for map window.
      EAST:        Define maximum longitude for map window.
      NORTH:       Define maximum latitude for map window.
      SOUTH:       Define minimum latitude for map window.

The following options allow the user to add station anotations and
topography and bathymetry to their maps.  The default topography
color map can be found in $SACAUX/ctables/gmt.cpt.  The grid files
are written in the current directory.
      TOPOgraphy on | off
      STAnames  on | off

The following options allow the user to scale the event symbols.
The default is a constant symbol size.
      MAGnitude:   Scale event symbols linearly with user0.
      REsidual:    Scale event symbols linearly with abs(user0).
                   Positive values are (+) negatives are (-).
      RMean_residual: Same as residual except mean is removed
		      from all the residuals.

      EVENTFILE:   Specify a free-format ascii text file containing additional
                   event data. Each line in the file contains data for a
single
                   event.  The first two columns of each line must contain
                   latitude and longitude (in degrees), respectively.  The
third
                   column is optional and contains symbol size information
(e.g.,
                   magnitudes, depth, travel-time residual, ...).
                   The following is an example of a few lines in an eventfile:
                         38.5    42.5   6.5
                         25.5    37.3   5.5
                         44.2    40.9   5.7


A TITLE can be specified using SAC2000's TITLE command.


DEFAULT VALUES:
MAP  MERCATOR TOPO off STA off

FUNCTIONAL MODULE: FK Spectrum (fks)

See also: TITLE

HEADER DATA:
Station latitudes (stla) and longitudes (stlo) must be set.  If event latitudes
(evla) and longitudes (evlo) are set they will be included in the map.  If this
command is executed after running BBFK, MAP  will plot a great circle arc path
along the back azimuth.

*** Notes ***
  The current version of MAP  was based on version 3.0 of the Generic
  Mapping Tools software and it assumes that the GMT3.0 software is
  loaded on the users machine.

  The results of each MAP  command are written to a
  shell file called gmt.csh, in the current directory.
  The user can modify this file to take advantage of gmt
  options not readily available through SAC2000.
