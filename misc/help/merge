SUMMARY:
Merges (concantenates) a set of files to data in memory.

SYNTAX:
MERGE {COMMIT|ROLLBACK|RECALLTRACE} {filelist}

INPUT:
      COMMIT  :  Commits headers and waveforms in SAC memory -- removing any 
                 previous versions of headers or waveforms from RAM -- prior
                 to merging files.  COMMIT is the default.

      ROLLBACK  :  reverts to the last committed version of the header and 
                   waveform before merging files.

      RECALLTRACE  :  - reverts to the last committed version of the waveform,
                - reverts to the last committed version of those header
                  variables closely linked to the waveform,
                - commits those header variables which are loosely linked
                  to the waveform.
                (use HELP RECALLTRACE for a list of which header variables are
                committed, and which are rolled back.)

      filelist  :  A list of SAC binary data files.  This list may contain
          simple filenames, full or relative pathnames, and wildcard
          characters.  See the READ command for a complete description.

DESCRIPTION:
The data in the files in this merge list is appended or concantenated to the
data in memory.  Each pair of files to be merged is checked to make sure they
have the same sampling interval and station name.  The end time of the first
file is also compared with the begin time of the second file.  If there is a
gap in these times, a warning message is generated and the appropriate number
of zeros is placed in the merged file.  If there is an overlap in these times,
an error message is generated and no merge is performed.

EXAMPLES:
To merge FILE3 and FILE4 to FILE1 and FILE2 respectively:
 
      u:  READ FILE1 FILE2
 
      u:  MERGE FILE3 FILE4
 
To merge files for the same station, say ELKO.Z, from four different events
each stored in a separate UNIX directory:
 
      u:  READ /data/event1/elko.z
 
      u:  MERGE /data/event2/elko.z
 
      u:  MERGE /data/event3/elko.z
 
      u:  MERGE /data/event4/elko.z
 
If you were on different kind of computer (i.e. not UNIX) then only the way
you specify full pathnames would be different.

Note:  for examples of the behavior of COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and RECALLTRACE, see
       the commands of the same name.
