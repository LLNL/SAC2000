SAC Command Reference Manual                                  PICKPHASE

SUMMARY:
Tell sac to read phase pick information (and possibly the author list) from
a user-defined preferences file, or interactively enter phase pick information 
on the PICKPHASE command line.

SYNTAX:
PICKPHASE header phase author {header phase author ... }
PICKPHASE FILE {filename}
PICKPHASE AUTHOR {filename}

INPUT:
        header: name of a header variable: t0 - t9.
        phase:  name of phase of pick desired for the given header variable.
        author: name of the author desired for the given header or hyphen, "-",
                to tell sac to use the author list.

	FILE:	if the FILE option is used, sac will read the phase pick info.
		from the preferences file.  If a filename is given on the 
		command line, sac will read the specified file, else it will
		read the most recently entered file name from a previous
		call to PICKPHASE.  If no filename was ever entered, sac
		will look for SACAUX/csspickprefs.

	PHASE:	this option behaves essencially like the FILE option with
		the added benefit of having sac read the author list as well.


DEFAULT VALUES:
PICKPHASE FILE  


DESCRIPTION:
PICKPHASE is provided as a means to override the preferences file on the
command line.  It can be used to provide specific header/phase/author 
information at the command line, or to redirect SAC from one preferences file
to another.  For more on the preferences files, see PICKPREFS and READCSS.

Note:  If the user alters the preference settings while data is in the data
buffers, the picks in the SAC data buffer (the buffer visible to the user
through LISTHDR and CHNHDR etc.) may be modified.
Eg. if the allowed phases include pP and PKiKP when some SAC files are read
with the READ command which have some pP picks or some PKiKP picks these picks
would be present in the Tn markers.  If PICKPHASE is later used to remove pP
and PKiKP from the allowed phases before the next READCSS MORE call,
then pP and PKiKP arrivals will not be read from the CSS files, and the pP and
PKiKP picks in the existing data will be removed from the Tn markers.  For an
explanation, type HELP PICKPREFS.
