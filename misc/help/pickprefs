SAC Command Reference Manual                                  PICKPREFS

SUMMARY:
The PICKPREFS command is used to control the way that SAC manages and or loads
picks from a variety of input data formats (e.g., CSS, GSE, SUDS etc...) into
the time marker variables T0 to T9 (aka. Tn).  When this option is OFF (the 
default), the picks loaded into the time markers correspond to the first picks 
that SAC finds in the input data.  If this options is ON, SAC will use the
preferences file described in the READCSS command.

Note:   Because of the structured nature of the preferences file (which aligns
	specific phases with specific marker variables), and the free flowing
	nature of the interactions without the preferences, a change in the 
	PICKPREFS in the middle of processing can change the picks in the 
	datafiles.  See the descrition below for details.

SYNTAX:
PICKPREFS ON
PICKPREFS OFF
PICKPREFS

INPUT:
        ON:     instructs SAC to pass arrivals from the CSS buffer through
                the preferences file on its way to the SAC buffer.  This
                is useful in macros that require specific arrivals to be
                in specific Tn header variables.

        OFF:    instructs SAC to bypass the preferences file and load the
		first 10 picks it encounters for a given file.  This is the
                default.  It allows the user to be aware of picks s/he may
                not be aware of with the PICKPREFS ON.

                If now option is provided on the commandline, PICKPREFS
                will toggle the use of preferences file ON or OFF.

DEFAULT VALUES:
PICKPREFS OFF


DESCRIPTION:
Since version 0.58, sac2000 has had two different header buffers: one formatted
according to the SAC file format, and one formatted according to the relational
CSS 3.0 file format.  Adding the CSS data buffer has made it easier to read 
relational formats such as CSS, GSE, and SUDS.  Having two buffers has allowed 
the process management commands:  COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and RECALLTRACE. 

One drawback of having these two buffers is the complexity of moving arrivals 
from the dynamic CSS arrival table to the rather ridged T0 - T9 picks in the 
SAC format.  This problem was solved in version 0.58 by setting in place a
preferences file called csspickprefs.  This file is in the misc directory and
can be overridden by writing one of your own.  For more information about how
to use the csspickprefs file, use HELP READCSS.  For details on how to override
the default preferences file, use HELP PICKAUTHOR or HELP PICKPHASE.

The drawback of using the preferences file was that it would only accept phase 
names and/or author names listed in the preferences file or those entered at
the command line with PICKPHASE or PICKAUTHOR.  In other words, if a CSS data
file from either a flat-file, or the Oracle database has a pP arrival, and pP
is not specified in the preferences file, the user would never know that the pP
is there.  The pP pick will be read into the CSS data buffer in SAC, but it
will not be transfered to the SAC data buffer, and will not participate in any
of the SAC commands.  It may be written out by the WRITECSS command, or it may
get flushed out during a COMMIT command, and be lost entirely.  

The solution we have worked out is to allow the user to bypass the preferences 
file.  In version 0.59, the default is to read the first 10 available picks
from the CSS buffer directly into the SAC buffer whenever data is transferred
from the one to the other.  By use of this new command, PICKPREFS, the user
can tell SAC to use the preferences file.  This is useful if the user has a
macro which expects to find a specific phase in a specific Tn header variable.

Data is transfered from the CSS buffer to the SAC buffer on any READCSS, READDB
(Oracle version of SAC only), READGSE, or READSUDS command, as well as COMMIT,
ROLLBACK, and RECALLTRACE.  COMMIT, ROLLBACK, or RECALLTRACE get called by
default by any of the following commands:
 - any command that writes data (WRITE, WRITECSS, WRITEGSE, etc.)
 - any command that reads data with the MORE option specified
 - the SORT command.

If the user alters PICKPREFS and or the preference settings while data is
in the data buffers, the picks in the SAC buffer may be modified.
Eg. if PICKPREFS is OFF (the default) when some SAC files are read 
with the READ command they may have some pP picks or some PKiKP picks which 
would be present in the Tn markers.  If PICKPREFS is later turned OFF, for
a READCSS (or READDB) call, if pP and/or PKiKP aren't listed in the preferences
file, then pP and PKiKP arrivals will not be read from the CSS files, and the
pP and PKiKP picks in the existing data will be removed from the Tn markers.
