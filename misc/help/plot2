SUMMARY:
Generates a multi-trace single-window (overlay) plot.

SYNTAX:
PLOT2 {ABSOLUTE|RELATIVE} {PRINT {pname} }

INPUT:
      ABSOLUTE  :  Plot files treating time as an absolute.  Files with
          different begin times will be shifted relative to the first file.  

      RELATIVE  :  Plot each file relative to it's own begin time.

      PRINT {pname}  :  Prints the resulting plot to the printer named in
           pname, or to the default printer if pname is not used.  (This
           makes use of the SGF capability.)


DEFAULT VALUES:
PLOT2 ABSOLUTE

DESCRIPTION:
All files in the data file list are plotted in the same plot window.  An
optional legend containing the plot symbol and file name can be generated.  
Fixed x and y axis limits may be defined before using this command.  See the
XLIM and YLIM commands.  The plot is sized to the extrema of the entire file
list if fixed limits are not requested.  An example is given on the next page.
The location of the legend is controlled by the FILEID command.

Unlike PLOT and PLOT1, PLOT2 will plot spectral data.  Real/Imaginary data is
plotted as Real vs. Frequency.  Amplitude/Phase data is plotted as Amplitude
vx. Frequency.  Imaginary and Phase information is ignored.  Spectral data is 
always plotted in relative mode.

Note:  If for some reason, the user has both time-series data and spectral data
in memory at the same time and does not elect to use the RELATIVE option, the 
time-series files will be plotted ABSOLUTE and the spectral files will be 
plotted RELATIVE.  Relative mode means relative to the first file.  So the 
order of the files in memory will effect the relation of the plots with respect
to each other.
