SAC Command Reference Manual                                     READDB

SUMMARY:
Reads data from Oracle database into memory.

NOTE:  To understand how the CSS picks are transfered to the SAC data buffers,
       type HELP PICKPREFS and HELP READCSS.

SYNTAX:
READDB [primary_option ...] database_option value [database_option value ...]

Where the primary options are:

      MORE:  Place the new data files in memory AFTER the old ones.  If this
          option is omitted, the new data files REPLACE the old ones.

          Note:  if the MORE option is not specified, the COMMIT, ROLLBACK,
                 and RECALLTRACE options have no effect.

      TRUST ON|OFF  :   This option is used to resolve an ambiguity in
                 converting files from SAC to CSS format.  When converting the
                 data matching event IDs could mean the files have identical
                 event information, or they could be an artifact of the
                 merging of these two very different formats.  When TRUST
                 is ON, SAC is more likely to accept matching event IDs as
                 identical event information than when TRUST is OFF,
                 depending on the history of READ commands associated with
                 the current data files in memory.

      COMMIT:  If the MORE option is specified, the COMMIT option commits
               headers and waveforms in SAC memory -- removing any previous
               versions of headers or waveforms from RAM -- prior to
               reading more files.  COMMIT is the default.

      ROLLBACK:  If the MORE option is specified, the ROLLBACK option reverts
                 to the last committed version of the header and waveform
                 before reading more files.

      RECALLTRACE:  If the MORE option is specified, the RECALLTRACE option:
                - reverts to the last committed version of the waveform,
                - reverts to the last committed version of those header
                  variables closely linked to the waveform,
                - commits those header variables which are loosely linked
                  to the waveform.
              (use HELP RECALLTRACE for a list of which header variables are
              committed, and which are rolled back.)

      SHIFT ON|OFF:  If SHIFT is on, the origin time is set to zero, and
          other time related header variables are shifted back to be
          consistent with the origin time.  Some of the distance related
          header variables are also affected.  SHIFT ON is the default.

      SCALE ON|OFF:  The SCALE option is OFF by default.
          When SCALE is OFF, SAC reads the data directly from the database.
          When SCALE is ON, SAC multiplies the waveform by a SCALE factor
          given in the .wfdisc table.  This scale option changes with the 
          SCALE options of READ SEGY, READCSS, READGSE, and READSUDS.
          If SCALE is OFF, the SCALE value from the database will be stored
          in SAC's SCALE header variable.  If SCALE is on, SAC's SCALE
          header field is set to 1.0.
          SCALE is a crude method of accounting for the instrument
          response.  The prefered method is with the TRANSFER command.  
          It is recommended to leave SCALE off for the READ and use
          the TRANSFER command.  SCALE should really only be used
          if the response information necessary for the TRANSFER command
          is not available.


      MAGNITUDE MB|MS|ML|DEF:
          Determines which value of magnitude to put into SAC2000's
          magnitude hearder variable.  MB gets the bodywave magnitude,
          MS gets the surfacewave magnitude, ML gets the local magnitude,
          and def (the default) follows this algorithm:  if Ms exists and
          is greater than or equal to 6.6, take it, else, if Mb exists take 
          it, else, if Ms exists take it, else take Ml.

          Note:  There are database options described later which allow
                 the user to select waveforms based on Mb magnitude, Ms
                 magnitude, or Ml magnitude.  These are different from 
                 the primary option MAGNITUDE which determines which 
                 magnitude is read into the header variable.  
                 eg. READDB MAGNITUDE ML MSMAG 5 8
                 This command will get waveforms from the database with
                 surface wave magnitudes between 5 and 8, but it will
                 read the local magnitude into sac's magnitude header
                 variable.  

The order that the options are entered on the command line matters only
in that all of the primary options must be entered before any of the 
database options.  

  All commands which load data into memory are now monitored to maintain
a level of confidence in the event information when moved from the SAC data
buffer to the CSS data buffer.  For READDB, when the confidence is HIGH that
all the data files are cosistent in the numbering of event IDs, matching
event IDs are treated as having identical event information.  When the
confidence is LOW in READDB, matching event IDs are understood as an artifact,
and new event IDs are generated for the incoming file.  If READDB is given with
the MORE option, and SCHEMA is used to change the name of the schema to be
accessed, then confidence is reduced from RDB to HIGH.
For more details use HELP READ.


Database options are described below:

Each database option is followed by one or more values separated by spaces 
or commas.  For help on specific options type READDB HELP optionName, 
e.g. READDB HELP HELP

EXAMPLES:
      In the following examples is it assummed that your connect string and
schema name are properly set in your configuration file (see SHOWDEFAULTS
below). To read all seismograms recorded at station ABKT on component BHZ
from events with epicenters with latitudes between 30 and 32 degrees and
with longitudes between 60 and 62 degrees:      
 
      u:  readdb srclat 30 32 srclon 60 62 staname ABKT component BHZ
 
      Having read those seismograms, perhaps you note that many have very
poor S/N and you only want to work with the larger events. You decide to
use a magnitude cutoff of Mb = 4.7 and know that no events have Mb > 7.0.
To retrieve events matching these new criteria:
      
      u:  readdb srclat 30 32 srclon 60 62 staname ABKT component BHZ mbmag 4.7 7.0

      Now you decide that you only want to load seismograms from events that occurred
within a 4 day interval starting on day 54 of 1994 and ending on day 57 of the same 
year. To accomplish this:

      u:  readdb srclat 30 32 srclon 60 62 staname abkt component bhz mbmag 4.7 7.0
          starttime 1994 054 endtime 1994 057 

      Suppose you want to look at aftershocks of an earthquake that occurred on
day 162 at 9:00 GMT in 1994 with an epicenter at 29 degrees latitude, 53 degrees
longitude. Based on the size of the mainshock you expect no aftershocks at distances
greater than 50 km from the mainshock epicenter. You also only want to see
seismograms from aftershocks with body wave magnitudes >= 4.7:
      
      u: readdb srccircle 29 53 50 sta abkt chan bhz mbmag 4.7 7.0 starttime 1994 162 09:00


Note:  for examples of the behavior of the COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and RECALLTRACE
       options, see the commands of the same names.  





MAXROWS OPTION
   MAXROWS MaxNumberofRows
Some queries can return very large numbers of seismograms. If
the memory required to load the seismograms approaches or
exceeds physical memory, performance is likely to be degraded.
Therefore readDB restricts all queries to return a maximum
number of rows. This number can be set in a configuration file
or it can be specified on the command line using the MAXROWS
option. If you use the MAXROWS option you must follow it with
a single positive number.
---------------------------------------------------------------


SHOWSQL OPTION
   SHOWSQL [ON | OFF]
ReadDB translates the options you specify into a series of SQL
commands that are used to extract the data from the Oracle data
base. To view the generated SQL use the SHOWSQL option. SHOWSQL
can be used either with or without parameters. If used without
parameters it acts as a toggle. That is, if the current state is
to not show generated SQL, then issuing a command that includes
the SHOWSQL option will change the state to ON. Otherwise, the
state is changed to OFF. You can also pass the parameters ON
and OFF to SHOWSQL to explicitly set the state.
---------------------------------------------------------------

CMDFILE OPTION
   CMDFILE filename
If you frequently use the same options with, perhaps, minor
variations from one use to the next, you may find it convenient
to save your command string in a file and then have readDB read
the commands from the file. The command string may be on one
line just as you would type it at the readDB prompt, or may be
spread over multiple lines. To process the command file use the
CMDFILE option followed by the file name of command file. When
you use the CMDFILE option, any other options on the readDB
command line are ignored.
---------------------------------------------------------------

SCHEMA OPTION
   SCHEMA schema-name
The CSS 3.0 tables containing the data used by readDB are
contained in a schema which you may or may not have access to
in your Oracle account. If you do not own the schema or have
a set of aliases to the tables in the schema then you must
supply the schema name to readDB. This can be done on the
command line i.e. 

 readDB ... options ... schema mena ... other options ...
 
or else can be done using a configuration file.
---------------------------------------------------------------



CONNECT OPTION
   CONNECT logname/passwd
A login name and password are required to connect to the Oracle
database. These are concatenated by readDB into a connect string
of the form   loginName/Password  . ReadDB constructs a default
connect string from your unix login name which is simply
login/login. If this matches your Oracle name and password you
do not need to do anything else to connect to Oracle using
readDB. Otherwise, specify the connect string yourself either on
the command line or in a configuration file. 
---------------------------------------------------------------



SHOWDEFAULTS OPTION
   SHOWDEFAULTS
A number of parameters are likely to stay the same from query to
query, and readDB keeps these parameters in memory. To see the
current state of these "sticky" parameters use the SHOWDEFAULTS
command. A typical listing follows.

Database to use:       mena
Max rows to return:    50
Oracle login name:     your_database_login
Oracle login password: your_database_password

(STLO)              is an alias for     (STALON)
(STDP)              is an alias for     (INSTDEPTH)
(DEF)               is an alias for     (SHOWDEFAULTS)
(AUTH)              is an alias for     (AUTHLIST)
(EVID)              is an alias for     (EVENTID)
(SQL)               is an alias for     (SHOWSQL)
(CF)                is an alias for     (CMDFILE)


Many of these defaults can be set on the readDB command line.
However, you may find it easier to set them in a configuration
file. The configuration file consists of a two types of
entries; keyword=value pairs  (one per line), and aliases.
The first part of the listing above shows the keyword-value
state and the second shows the current aliases.

The following is an example of the contents of the
configuration file that produced the listing above.

The configuration file can be located anywhere in the file
system where you have read access, and can have any legal name.
However, you must make it known to readDB by setting the
environment variable DBSELECT_CONFIG_FILE to the fully-qualified
filename, e.g.

setenv DBSELECT_CONFIG_FILE=/us/dodge/SeisMgr/dbselect.ini
---------------------------------------------------------------




SRCLAT, SRCLON, SRCDEP OPTIONS
   SRCLAT lat1 lat2
   SRCLON lon1 lon2
   SRCDEP dep1 dep2
The SRCLAT, SRCLON, and SRCDEP options can be used either singly
or together to restrict seismograms read by readDB to sources
contained within a certain geographical range. Each of these
options requires both a minimum and maximum value. In the case
of longitudes, first argument values greater than 180 have 360
subtracted so that you may make selections like: SRCLON 355 20
and get seismograms from sources between 5 degrees west
longitude to 20 degrees east longitude rather than from the
complementary range of longitudes.
---------------------------------------------------------------


SRCBOX OPTION
   SRCBOX file=filename or lat lon lat lon lat lon ...
ReadDB can also restrict seismograms to events with origins
inside a user-defined polygonal geographic region. The 
polygon is defined by a set of lat-lon pairs which are the
vertices of the polygon. The vertices must be listed in
counter-clockwise order, and the last vertex is expected to be
the same as the starting vertex. The vertices may either be
listed on the command line after the SRCBOX keyword or else
they may be contained in a file with one vertex per line. To
use the file, give its name to readDB after the SRCBOX keyword
For example: SRCBOX file=Myfile.polygon
---------------------------------------------------------------




SRCTYPE OPTION
   SRCTYPE type1, type2 ...
You can restrict retrieved waveforms to be just those generated
by certain types of sources by using the SRCTYPE keyword
followed by one or more source specifiers. Example source
specifiers are:
--------------------------
-       Source type not set
eq      Earthquake
ex      Other explosion
qmt     Quarry or mining-induced events: tremors and rockbursts
u       Unknown source type
---------------------------------------------------------------



SRCCIRCLE OPTION
   SRCCIRCLE  latCenter, lonCenter, radius (km)
The SRCCIRCLE option is used to select seismograms from events
with epicenters within a specified distance from some point on
the earth's surface. You must specify the latitude and longitude
of the circle center and its radius in kilometers.
---------------------------------------------------------------




MBMAG, MLMAG, MSMAG OPTIONS
   MBMAG minmag maxmag
   MLMAG minmag maxmag
   MSMAG minmag maxmag
The MBMAG, MLMAG, and MSMAG options are used to restrict
waveforms by source magnitude. Each of these options must be
followed by a minimum value and a maximum value. To restrict by
Mb use MBMAG, to restrict by Ml use MLMAG, and to restrict by Ms
use MSMAG. Note that if the source has not been assigned a
magnitude of the type specified, then it will be excluded.
---------------------------------------------------------------



EVENTID OPTION
   EVENTID  file=filename or ID ID ID ...
You can restrict the seismograms selected by readDB to be
associated with a specific set of events by providing a list of
evids to readDB. After the EVENTID option you can supply a 
comma- or space-delimited list of evids. Alternatively, give 
the name of a file containing the evid list (one evid per line)
---------------------------------------------------------------



STANAME, COMPONENT OPTIONS
   STANAME name1, name2, ...
   COMPONENT comp1 comp2, ...
The STANAME and COMPONENT options may be used either singly or
in combination to restrict the waveforms by station and/or
component. Stations to select from can be listed on the 
command line in a space- or comma-delimited list, or the station
names can be put in a file (one station name per line) and the
file name can be specified on the command line using the syntax
file=filename. Components may only be specified on the command
line. 

To see what stations and components are currently available in
the database you can use the option:
   HELP STANAME
   
This will produce a complete listing of available stations
and components available for each station. A short example
is shown below.

You can also get information about a specific station using the
option:
   HELP STANAME station-name

For example here is information for station ABKT.

STALAT, STALON, INSTDEPTH  OPTIONS
   STALAT    minlat maxlat
   STALON    minlon maxlon
   INSTDEPTH mindepth maxdepth
The STALAT, STALON, and INSTDEPTH options can be used singly
or together to restrict seismograms read by readDB to stations
contained within a certain geographical range. Each of these
options requires both a minimum and maximum value. In the case
of longitudes, first argument values greater than 180 have 360
subtracted so that you may make selections like: STALON 355 20
and get seismograms from sources between 5 degrees west
longitude to 20 degrees east longitude rather than from the
complementary range of longitudes.
---------------------------------------------------------------



STARTTIME, ENDTIME OPTIONS
   STARTTIME  YYYY/DDD/HH:MM:SS.SSS or YYYY/MM/DD/HH:MM:SS.SSS
The STARTTIME and ENDTIME options are used to select waveforms by
time. If a StartTime is specified then only waveforms with begin
times >= the specified time will be selected. If the EndTime is 
specified then only waveforms with endtimes <= the specified
time will be used. 

There are two basic formats for specifying time, one using 
month/day format, and the other using day-of-year format.

      YYYY/MM/DD/HH:MM:SS.SSS
      YYYY/DDD/HH:MM:SS.SSS

legal separators between tokens are '/ - : ' as well as the space
and tab characters.

Subsets of the formats are also supported as long as they are not
ambiguous. For instance YYYY DDD HH will be interpreted as
YYYY/DDD/HH:00:00.000. Note that if day-of year format is used and
if the day-of year is given with only 2 digits, the string will be
ambiguous unless the remainder of the string is complete to the
second and the second has a non-zero number of milliseconds. I.E.
1997 12 22 13 will be ambiguous, but 1997 12 22 13.45 will not be.
-----------------------------------------------------------------



SRCDIST, SRCDELT OPTIONS 
   SRCDIST  minDist maxDist (in km), minDist defaults to 0
The SRCDIST and SRCDELT options both are used to restrict
retrieved seismograms to be from events with epicenters within
a distance range from a selected station. SRCDIST expects that
the distance will be specified in kilometers and SRCDELT expects
the distance to be in degrees. Both options require that one
station has been selected using the STANAME option. If just one
distance is specified, then both commands treat that distance as
a maximum. If two distances are specified, then the selected
events will be within the distance range bounded by the two
values.
---------------------------------------------------------------



QUADRANT OPTION
   QUADRANT   minAzimuth maxAzimuth
The QUADRANT option is used to select seismograms from events
with epicenters within a specified back-azimuth range from a
selected station. You must specify one station using the
STANAME option and you must specify a minimum back-azimuth
and a maximum back-azimuth.
---------------------------------------------------------------



PHASELIST OPTION
   PHASELIST phase1, phase2, ...
By default readDB will find all picks associated with each
seismogram it retrieves. If you wish to only get picks of
certain phases you can specify your desired phases, either
in the configuration file or on the readDB command line. To
specify one or more phases on the command line, use the
PHASELIST option followed by a space- or comma-delimited list
of phases. You can find what phases are currently available
in the database using the option:
   HELP PHASELIST

This will produce a listing like:
PHASE   Nobs

AUTHLIST OPTION
   AUTHLIST auth1 auth2 ...
By default readDB will find all picks associated with each
seismogram it retrieves. If you wish to only get picks by
certain authors you can specify your preferred authors, either
in the configuration file or on the readDB command line. To
specify one or more authors on the command line, use the
AUTHLIST option followed by a space- or comma-delimited list
of authors. To find what pick authors are available in the database
use the option READDB HELP AUTHLIST.

Note:  Before inlcuding author names in the AUTHLIST, be certain that
       these authors are in the author list used to read data from
       the CSS data buffers to the SAC data buffers.  For details,
       use HELP PICKPREFS and HELP READCSS.
