SUMMARY:
Reads spectral files written by WRITESP and WRITESPE.

SYNTAX:
READSP {AMPH|RLIM|SPE} {filelist}

INPUT:
      RLIM  :  Read real and imaginary components.  

      AMPH  :  Read amplitude and phase components.  

      SPE  :  Read spectral estimation subprocess files.  The data is
          converted from power to amplitude.  The phase component is set to
          zeros.  

      filelist  :  A list of SAC binary data files.  This list may contain
          simple filenames, full or relative pathnames, and wildcard
          characters.  See the READ command for a complete description.

DEFAULT VALUES:
READSP AMPH

DESCRIPTION:
The WRITESP command writes each spectral data component to disk as a separate
file.  You may then process each component separately.  This command lets you
reconstruct the spectral data from the two components.  See the WRITESP
documentation for more details.  The SPE option allows you to read in and
convert to spectral format, files that were written using the WRITESPE
command in the Spectral Estimation Subprocess. This allows you to use
commands such as MULOMEGA and DIVOMEGA on these spectral estimates.

      Any command which loads data into memory is monitored to maintain a
level of confidence in the event infomation when transfered from the SAC
data buffer to the CSS data buffer.  When READSP is used, the confidence
is set to LOW, indicating that SAC should consider any matching event IDs
as artifacts and reassign the event ID of the incoming file.  For more 
details, use HELP READ.


EXAMPLES:
See the example in the WRITESP documentation.
