
SAC Command Reference Manual                                  READSUDS

SUMMARY:
Read data files in PC-SUDS format from disk into memory.

Note:  SUDS data enters SAC via SAC's CSS data buffers.  To understand how
       arrivals are handled, use HELP READCSS and HELP PICKPREFS.



SYNTAX:
READSUDS {MAXMEM v} {MORE} {VERBOSE ON|OFF} {SHIFT ON|OFF} 
{COMMIT|ROLLBACK|RECALLTRACE} {DIR name}  filelist 
 
  

INPUT:
      MAXMEM: Specify the maximum fraction of physical memory to use when
          reading large data sets. When this limit is reached, no more 
          waveforms will be read, although other tables may still be read.
          The default value for MAXMEM is 0.3.
          
      MORE  :  See the READ command.  
      
      VERBOSE ON|OFF: If VERBOSE is ON, SAC displays extended information
          about the waveforms being read, and prints a summary of the CSS
          tables that were filled. SAC also displays a progress indicator 
          for the conversion to SAC internal format.

      SHIFT ON|OFF:  If SHIFT is on, the origin time is set to zero, and
	  other time related header variables are shifted back to be
	  consistent with the origin time.  Some of the distance related 
	  header variables are also affected.  SHIFT ON is the default.
 
      COMMIT  :  If the MORE option is specified, the COMMIT option commits
                  headers and waveforms in SAC memory -- removing any previous
                  versions of headers or waveforms from RAM -- prior to 
                  reading more files.  COMMIT is the default.  
 
      ROLLBACK  :  If the MORE option is specified, the ROLLBACK option reverts
                    to the last committed version of the header and waveform
                    before reading more files.  
 
      RECALLTRACE  :  If the MORE option is specified, the RECALLTRACE option:
               - reverts to the last committed version of the waveform, 
               - reverts to the last committed version of those header 
                 variables closely linked to the waveform, 
               - commits those header variables which are loosely linked 
                 to the waveform.  
                 (use HELP RECALLTRACE for a list of which header variables are 
                 committed, and which are rolled back.)

           Note:  if the MORE option is not specified, the COMMIT, ROLLBACK, 
                  and RECALLTRACE options have no effect.  


      DIR name  :  The directory to be searched for sudsfile(s).  

      filelist  :  The name(s) of one or more suds files.  

DEFAULT VALUES:
READSUDS * MAXMEM 0.3 VERBOSE OFF COMMIT

DESCRIPTION:
See the READ command.  Oct. 27, 1998 (Version 00.58)

      Any command which loads data into memory is monitored to maintain a
level of confidence in the event infomation when transfered from the SAC
data buffer to the CSS data buffer.  When READSUDS is used, the confidence
is set to LOW, indicating that SAC should consider any matching event IDs
as artifacts and reassign the event ID of the incoming file.  For more 
details, use HELP READ.


NOTES:

READSUDS assumes that the data are still in PC byte-order, and swaps bytes 
as necessary while reading the files. 

The following SUDS headers should be populated:
	DESCRIPTRACE
	STATIONCOMP
	FEATURE
	EVENT
	ORIGIN

Statident structs for a given channel must have all fields set identically 
to allow joining: i.e. dt->dt_name = fe->fe_name = sc->sc_name.

There should be only 1 origin and 1 event in the SUDS file since PC-SUDS has 
no way to associate origins with features or descriptraces.

ev->number must equal or->number to associate the event with the origin.

SUDS Magnitude, Authority, Program, Instrument, and Phase codes must be from the
following code lists in order to translate to CSS.
