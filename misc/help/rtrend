SUMMARY:
Removes the linear trend.

SYNTAX:
RTREND

DESCRIPTION:
A least squares curve fit to a straight line is calculated.  This straight
line or trend is then "subtracted" from the data.  The data does not have to
be evenly spaced.

OUTPUT: The best fitting straight line parameters for the last file in 
the data file list are written to blackboard variables begining with RTR. 
RTR_SLP is the slope of the line. 
RTR_SDSLP is the standard deviation in the slope. 
RTR_YINT is the y intercept of the line.
RTR_SDYINT is the standard deviation in the y intercept.
RTR_SDDTA is the standard deviation in the data. 
RTR_CORRCF is the data correlation coeficient.  

ERROR MESSAGES:
1301: No data files read in.

1307: Illegal operation on spectral file
