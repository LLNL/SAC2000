READ

SUMMARY:       Reads data from a SAC data file into memory.

SYNTAX:        [R]EAD file

INPUT:  file   A legal filename.



DESCRIPTION
This command works just like the READ command in the main SAC program
with two exceptions.
First, only ONE file may be read in while in SPE.
Second, executing this command deletes any correlation function or
spectral estimate that may already have been computed.
Parameters within SPE, such as the number of prewhitening coefficients
or the window type and length, are not changed when this command
is executed.
To reinitialize all SPE parameters, terminate the subprocess using
the QUITSUB command and then start it over again.
