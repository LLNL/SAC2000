Introduction
   SSS is primarily a package for doing signal stacking (i.e. summation or
beamforming).
   Each signal (i.e. SAC file) has properties such as a static delay, epicentral
distance, weighting factor, and polarity associated with it.
The dynamic delays can be calculated using a normal moveout or refracted
wave velocity model.
   Certain delay properties can be automatically incremented between summations.
Files are easily added to or removed from the stack file list.
The time window for the stack is easily adjusted.
Files which do not contain data throughout the stack time window are filled
with zeros.
   The stack file list can be plotted with or without the summation.
Each summation can be saved on disk for later use.
A record section plot is also included in this subprocess.

This is a SAC subprocess.
   A subprocess is like a small program within the main SAC program.
You start a subprocess by typing its name (SSS in this case.)
You can terminate it and return to the main program using the quitsub
command.  You can also terminate SAC from within a subprocess using
the QUIT command.
   While within a subprocess, you can execute any command belonging to
that subprocess plus a limited number of main SAC commands.
A list of the allowed main SAC commands is included in this document.

The Commands

Overview
The remainder of this manual contains the documentation on each of
the SSS commands. They are in alphabetical order and are also summarized below.
The format and notation is the same as the SAC Command Reference Manual.
A list of the allowed main SAC commands is also shown below.
You can also use all of the SAC macro features in this subprocess.

                  dynamic delays.
VELOCITYROSET     Controls placement of a velocity roset on subsequent
                  record section plots.
