Introduction
   SSS is primarily a package for doing signal stacking (i.e. summation or 
beamforming).
   Each signal (i.e. SAC file) has properties such as a static delay, epicentral
distance, weighting factor, and polarity associated with it.
The dynamic delays can be calculated using a normal moveout or refracted
wave velocity model.
   Certain delay properties can be automatically incremented between summations.
Files are easily added to or removed from the stack file list.
The time window for the stack is easily adjusted.
Files which do not contain data throughout the stack time window are filled
with zeros.
   The stack file list can be plotted with or without the summation.
Each summation can be saved on disk for later use.
A record section plot is also included in this subprocess.

This is a SAC subprocess.
   A subprocess is like a small program within the main SAC program.
You start a subprocess by typing its name (SSS in this case.)
You can terminate it and return to the main program using the quitsub
command.  You can also terminate SAC from within a subprocess using
the QUIT command.
   While within a subprocess, you can execute any command belonging to
that subprocess plus a limited number of main SAC commands.
A list of the allowed main SAC commands is included in this document.

SUMMARY:           Add a new file to the stack file list.

SYNTAX:            [A]DD[S]TACK filename [property ...]
                   where property is one or more of the following:
			[W]EIGHT v
			[DI]STANCE v
			[DE]LAY v [[S]ECONDS|[P]OINTS]
			[I]NCREMENT v [[S]ECONDS|[P]OINTS]
			[N]ORMAL
			[R]EVERSE

INPUT:
                         filename  Name of the file to be added to the 
				   stack file list.
                       [W]EIGHT v  Weighting factor for this file in 
				   the range zero to one.  Each data point is 
				   multiplied by this value when the stack 
				   is summed.
                     [DI]STANCE v  Station to epicenter distance in 
				   kilometers for this file.  This is 
				   used to calculate dynamic time delays.
    [DE]LAY v [[S]ECONDS|[P]OINTS] Static time delay to apply to file.
                                   This delay is in either seconds or 
				   number of data points.
[I]NCREMENT v [[S]ECONDS|[P]OINTS] Static time delay increment for this file.
                                   This increment is in either seconds or 
				   number of data points.  The static time 
				   delay is incremented by this ammount each 
				   time the  incrementstack command is executed.
                          [N]ORMAL File has normal polarity.
                        [R]EVERSED File has reversed polarity.
                                   (Each data point in the signal is multiplied
				   by -1.0 when the stack is summed.)

TYPE:              Parameter-setting

DEFAULTS VALUES:   Each file is given the global property value if no local 
		   one is entered.  The default units for the DELAY and 
		   INCREMENT options is SECONDS.

DESCRIPTION
There are five properties associated with each stack list file.

They are:
   the weighting factor.

   the station to epicenter distance.

   The static time delay in either seconds or number of data points.

   The static time delay increment in either seconds or number of data points.

   The polarity of the file, either normal or reversed.

There is a global value associated with each of these properties.
They are defined by the globalstack command.
When a file is added to the stack file list, that file's properties 
will be set to the global value if no local value is given.  
The changestack command can be used to change a file's
properties after it has been added to the stack file list.

EXAMPLES
The following examples illustrate several of the features of the
Signal Stacking Module.  Suppose you entered the following set of commands:

	u:  GLOBALSTACK DELAY 1.0 INCREMENT 0.03
	u:  ADDSTACK FILEA DELAY 2.0
	u:  ADDSTACK FILEB DELAY 3.0 INCREMENT 0.01 REVERSED
	u:  ADDSTACK FILEC
	u:  ADDSTACK FILED WEIGHT 0.5

The first command changes the global property values for time delay and 
time delay increment.
The other global properties have their default values.  
FILEA's properties would be the global ones except for the time delay.
FILEB's properties would be the global ones except for the time delay,
the time delay increment, and the signal polarity.
FILEC's properties would be the same as the global ones.
FILED's properties would be the global ones except for the weighting factor.
Now you enter:

	u:  SUMSTACK

The summation is done on the four files in the stack file list:
FILEA, FILEB, FILEC, and FILED.  
The time delays are  2.0, 3.0, 1.0, and 1.0 respectively. 
The polarity of FILEC is reversed.
FILED's weighting in the summation is half that of the other files.
Now you enter:

	u:  INCREMENTSTACK
	u:  CHANGESTACK FILEC NORMAL
	u:  SUMSTACK

This stack is performed with the following delays:
2.03, 3.01, 1.03, and 1.03.  The polarity of FILEC is now normal.
Now you enter:

	u:  DELETESTACK FILED
	u:  INCREMENTSTACK
	u:  SUMSTACK

This third stack is performed on the three files:
FILEA, FILEB, and FILEC.  The delays are 2.06, 3.02, and 1.06 respectively.

ERRORS MESSAGES:

    5108: Maximum length of stack file list exceeded.
    1306: Illegal operation on unevenly spaced file
          - stacking module requires evenly spaced data files.
    1307: Illegal operation on spectral file
    5109: Sampling intervals are not equal.
          - the sampling rates for all files in the stack file list must agree
            to within a given tolerance.
          - the SRCHECK command can turn this check off or change the tolerance.
          - the default check is for agreement within machine roundoff error.


LIMITATIONS
The maximum number of files in the stack file list is limited
to the maximum number of data files allowed by SAC.

                       [R]EVERSED  File has reversed polarity.  (Each data 
				   point in the signal is multiplied by -1.0 
				   when the stack is summed.)

DESCRIPTION
This command allows you to change any of the properties associated with
files in the stack file list.  These properties are discussed in more detail inthe  ADDSTACK command and an example of the use of this command is given there.
This command leaves all other properties for all other files unchanged.

DEFAULTS VALUES:   DELTACHECK ROUNDOFF

TYPE:              Parameter-setting

DESCRIPTION
This command changes the sampling rate checking option.
When this option is off, no check is made to see if the sampling rates
for each of the files in the stack file list agree.
When this option is on, then the sampling rates must agree within a given
tolerance or it is considered an error.
The tolerance can be set to a factor near the roundoff error for a particular
machine or it can be set to a specific value.
The absolute value of the difference between all sampling rates must be
less than or equal to this tolerance in order to be allowed.

ERROR MESSAGES:
The check is done and the error is reported as files are added to the
stack file list (see  ADDSTACK).

DISTANCEAXIS

SUMMARY:           Define the record section plot distance axis parameters.

SYNTAX:            [D]ISTANCE[A]XIS FIXED v|SCALED v

INPUT:
      FIXED v      Force axis length to be $v$ cm long.
     SCALED v      Allow the axis length to be scaled to the data.
                   The axis length (in cm) will be the range of the axis 
		   (in km.) divided by v.

DEFAULTS VALUES:   DISTANCEAXIS FIXED 35

TYPE:              Parameter-setting

DESCRIPTION
This command defines the properties of the distance axis for subsequent
record section plots (see  PLOTRECORDSECTION.)
The length of the axis can be a fixed size or it can be scaled to the
range of the axis variable (distance in this case.)
The TIMEAXIS command controls the time axis properties.

EXAMPLES
If you entered the following command:

	u:  DISTANCEAXIS SCALED 2.0

and the minimum and maximum distances in the data set being plotted are
150 and 300 km respectively, the distance axis would be 75 cm long.

KNOWN BUGS:
The y to x aspect ratio defined by this command and by the  TIMEAXIS
command is correct on plots to any device.  
The physical size requested is ignored when plotting to an interactive
device (e.g. TERMINAL, XWINDOWS)
If the SGF device is requested, the physical size is stored in these files.
The current SGF plot programs do not have the capability to make arbitrary
sized plots (i.e. panelling).  This panelling option is planned for a
future release.

DESCRIPTION
This command allows you to define global stack properties.
These global properties are associated with each file as it is added to the stack
file list (see ADDSTACK) unless local values are given for that file.
These properties are discussed in more detail in
the  ADDSTACK command and an example of the use of this command is given there.

INCREMENTSTACK 

SUMMARY:            Increments properties for files in the stack file list.

SYNTAX:             [I]NCREMENT[S]TACK

DEFAULTS VALUES:    All property iNCREMENT values are initially 0.

DESCRIPTION
The properties that can be incremented are the static time delay,
the apparent velocity, and the velocity model intercept time.
Property increment values of 0. obviously leave those properties unchanged.
The apparent velocity or the velocity model intercept time can be incremented,
and the other one calculated in order to maintain a zero delay at a
specified point.
An example of this is shown below.

EXAMPLES
An example of the use of this command to INCREMENT static time delays is
shown in the ADDSTACK command.  An example of the use of this command
to increment dynamic delays is given below:

	u: ADDSTACK FILEA 
	u: ADDSTACK FILEB
	u: ADDSTACK FILEC 
	u: ADDSTACK FILED 
	u: VELOCITYMODEL 1 REFR VAPP 7.9 VAPPI 0.1 T0VM CALC DIST 320. TVM 45.
	u: SUMSTACK
	u: WRITESTACK STACK1
	u: INCREMENTSTACK
	u: SUMSTACK
	u: WRITESTACK STACK2
	u: INCREMENTSTACK
	u: SUMSTACK
	u: WRITESTACK STACK3

The above commands will produce three summations, the results being
stored in SAC files STACK1, STACK2, and STACK3.
The refracted wave velocity model is used and the apparent velocities, VAPP
are 7.9, 8.0 and 8.1 respectively.
The velocity model intercept time, T0VM, is calculated in each case
to maintain a zero delay at the point 320. km and 45. seconds.

DESCRIPTION
This command plots the files in the stack file list in a record section format.
The effect of a particular velocity model can be easily seen with this plot.
See the example below.
The y axis is time and the x axis is epicentral distance.
The files are plotted along the time axis.
The zero amplitude of each file is plotted at its epicentral distance
along the x axis.
A distance must be defined for all files in the stack file list for this
plot to be generated.
The distance can come from the header or it can be defined in the DISTANCE
option of the  GLOBALSTACK,  ADDSTACK, or  CHANGESTACK command.
The  DISTANCEWINDOW and  TIMEWINDOW commands control how much data
will be displayed.
The  DISTANCEAXIS and  TIMEAXIS commands control the size of each axis
and thus the aspect ratio of the complete plot.
Only the  TIMEWINDOW command is required before executing this command.
Dynamic delays are controlled by the use of
the  VELOCITYMODEL command.
A line showing the effects of a second velocity model is also controlled
by the  VELOCITYMODEL command.
A velocity rosette showing the effects of other velocities can be placed on
this plot. It is controlled by the  VELOCITYROSET command.
Static delays if they have been defined are also applied to each of the signals.

SUMMARY:              Plots the files in the stack file list.

SYNTAX:               [P]LOT[S]TACK [ options ]
                      where options are one or more of the following:
                           [S]UM ON | OFF
                           [P]ERPLOT ON | OFF | n
                           [W]EIGHT ON | OFF
                           [P]OLARITY ON | OFF

INPUT:
       SUM ON | OFF    When this option is on the summed file is 
		       plotted first followed by the files in the stack 
		       file list.  When this option is off, the summed 
		       file is not plotted.
   PERPLOT ON | OFF    Turn the per plot option on or off.  When this 
		       option is on, a fixed number of files are plotted 
		       in each frame.  When this option is off, all of 
		       the files in the stack file list are plotted in 
		       a single frame.
          PERPLOT n    Turn the per plot option on  and set the number 
		       of files per frame to n.
    WEIGHT ON | OFF    Turn the file weighting option on or off.
  POLARITY ON | OFF    Turn the file polarity option on or off.

DEFAULTS VALUES: PLOTSTACK SUM ON PERPLOT OFF WEIGHT ON POLARITY ON

TYPE:  Action-producing

DESCRIPTION
This command plots the files in the stack file list.
The files are always plotted with their delays.
They may be plotted with or without their weighting factors and polarities.
They may also be plotted with or without the summed signal.
A selectable number of the files can be plotted on each frame.
The format of the plot is identical to that of the PLOT1 command.
Each file is plotted in its own subplot region.
These subplot regions have a common x axis and separte y axes.
A legend consisting of the file name and any non-default properties is
placed in the upper left-hand corner of each subplot region.
The stack time window (see  TIMEWINDOW) must be defined before 
executing this command.

QUITSUB

SUMMARY:   Terminates the Signal Stacking Subprocess.

SYNTAX:    [Q]uit[S]UB

TYPE:      Action-producing

DESCRIPTION
Terminates the Signal Stacking Subprocess and returns to the main
SAC program.  Use the QUIT command to terminate SAC.
This command also deletes the current stack summation from memory.
Use the WRITESUM command to save this summation on disk prior to
executing this command if you want it saved.
Stack file list properties and global properties values are retain
their values if you use this command to return to the main program
and then later reenter the Signal Stacking Subprocess within the
same SAC session.

SUMSTACK

SUMMARY:                   Sums the files in the stack file list.

SYNTAX:                    [S]UM[S]STACK  [[N]ORMALIZATION ON|OFF]

INPUT  
   NORMALIZATION ON | OFF  Turn normalization option on or off.
			   When this option is on the resulting 
			   summation is normalized by dividing each 
			   point by a factor that is the sum of 
			   each file's weight.

DEFAULTS VALUES:           SUMSTACK NORMALIZATION ON

TYPE:                      Action-producing

DESCRIPTION
This command sums the files in the stack file list.
A stack time window (see  TIMEWINDOW) must have been defined before
this command is executed.  
Each signal is shifted in accordance with its static and dynamic delays.
Zeros are added to the sum for that part of each file that is 
not in the time window.
Each file is given the requested weighting and files with reversed polarity
are inverted.
A plot of the summation is automatically produced.
The summation can be saved on disk using the WRITESUM command.

ERRORS MESSAGES: 5103: No time window defined.

TIMEAXIS

SUMMARY:          Controls the time axis properties on 
		  subsequent record section plots.

SYNTAX:           [T]IME[A]XIX [F]IXED v|[S]CALED v

INPUT:
    FIXED v       Fix the length of the time axis in cm to v.
   SCALED v       Scale the length of the time axis in cm to be
		  v times the total time window.

DEFAULTS VALUES:  TIMEAXIS FIXED 23.0

TYPE:             Parameter-setting

EXAMPLES:
If you are making several record setion plots with different time
windows and you wnat each 2 seconds on these plots to be 1 cm long:

	u:  TIMEAXIS SCALED 0.5


KNOWN BUGS:
The y and x aspect ration defined byh this command and byh the
 DISTANCEAXIS command is correct onplots to any device.  The physical
size requested is ignored when plotting to an interactive device
(e.g. TERMINAL, XWINDOWS)  If the SGF device is requested, the
physical size is stored in these files.  The current SGF plot programs do
not have the capability ot make arbitrary sized plots (i.e. panelling).
This panelling option is planned for a future release.

TIMEWINDOW

SUMMARY:         Sets the time window limits for subsequent stack summations.

SYNTAX:          [T]IME[W]INDOW v1 v2

INPUT
    v1 v2        The time window limits to use when reading in files 
	         before doing a stack summation.

DEFAULT VALUES:  None.  You MUST specify a time window before 
		 doing a summation (see  <A HREF=#sumstack>SUMSTACK</A>.)

DESCRIPTION
This command sets the stack time window.
This is the time window that will be used in subsequent  SUMSTACK
 PLOTSTACK, and  PLOTRECORDSECTION commands.
The stack time window must be defined before any of these commands are executed.
If a particular file does not fall entirely within this stack time window
enough zeros are added before or after the actual data to make up the difference.

		The use of each velocity model is described below.
       ON|OFF   Turn velocity model option on or off.  When this 
		option is on the model is applied. When off it is ignored.
REFRACTEDWAVE   Turn velocity model option on and change to the "refracted wave" model.

                INCREMENTSTACK command is executed.
       T0VMI v  Set the time axis intercept increment to v.  The time 
		axis intercept is incremented by this ammount each time the
                INCREMENTSTACK command is executed.

DEFAULT VALUES: VELOCITYMODEL 1 OFF
                VELOCITYMODEL 2 OFF

TYPE: Parameter-setting

DESCRIPTION:
The first velocity model is used in calculating dynamic station delays
for a particular phase.
It is applied when doing a stack summation ( SUMSTACK), 
a stack plot ( PLOTSTACK), or a record section plot ( PLOTRECORDSECTION.) 
The second velocity model is used in the record section plot to 
show delays associated with a second phase.
The parameters associated with the two velocity models can be easily flipped.
<P>
There are two different types of velocity models ("refracted wave" and
"normal moveout") that can be applied.
They are defined by the following equations:

          TDELAY = TVM(1) - ( T0VM + DIST / VAPP )
          TDELAY = TVM(1) - SQRT ( T0VM**2 + ( DIST / VAPP )**2 )

There are several ways in which these velocity model delays can be calculated:

   Enter values for VAPP, T0VM, and TVM(1) directly.

   Enter values for DVM(1), TVM(1), and either VAPP or T0VM.
   SAC will calculate the missing variable such that TDELAY will be zero
   at the distance given by DVM(1).

   Enter values for DVM(1), TVM(1), DVM(2), and TVM(2).
   SAC will calculate both VAPP and T0VM such that TDELAY will be zero
   at the distance given by DVM(1).

EXAMPLES:
To set the first stack velocity model the refracted wave model with an
apparent velocity of 6.5 km/sec and to have SAC calculate T0VM such that the
delay at 200 km will be zero:

    u: VELOCITYMODEL 1 REFRACTEDWAVE VAPP 6.5 T0VM CALCULATE DVM 200 TVM 35
