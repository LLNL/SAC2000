TRAVELTIME

SUMMARY:      Computes travel-time curves for pre-defined models or 
              reads travel-time curves from ascii text files.  

NOTE:         Can be called only from within the SSS subprocess.

SYNTAX:
1.  TRAVELTIME [MORE] [MODEL [string] ] [DEPTH depth] [BB fnum vname]
               [PICKS [n] ] [PHASE phaselist]

2.  TRAVELTIME [MORE] [DIR CURRENT|name] [UNITS DEGREES|KM] [HEADER count]
               [CONTENT string] [PICKS [n] ] filelist

3.  TRAVELTIME [DIR CURRENT|name] [PICKS [n] ] TAUP filename

the first syntax runs a model (for now iasp91 is the only available model),
the second syntax reads collumn data, and the third syntax reads the output of 
taup_curve (a traveltime estimator by Philip Crotwell at the University of 
South Carolina, for details see http://www.seis.sc.edu/software/index.html).  

INPUT:  
        MORE           signifies addition of more phases (syntax 1) or 
                       files (syntax 2) to current traveltime curves rather
                       than replacement of the current list with the new one. 
        MODEL string   to select the model to use to calculate the
                       travel times.  Currently iasp91 is the only available
                       model.
        DEPTH depth    Depth at which to produce curves (floaing point number)
        BB fnum vname  store a time in a blackboard variable.
                       fnum is an integer specifying the filenumber of a file
                       in SAC's memory.
                       The time of the first phase in the phase list for
                       the specified file is stored in the black board variable
                       specified by the string vname.
                       In case of a null value, the blackboard variable
                       will take the value -12345.0
        PICKS n        fills the arrival header fields with the appropriate
                       times.  n specifies the first arrival field to use.
                       For example, if n is 6, the first phase will be written
                       in T6, the second in T7, the third in T8 and the fourth
                       in T9.  In this case, the fifth and subsequent phases
                       will not be written to header fields, but the curves
                       will be displaied with the PLOTRECORDSECTION command if
                       the TTIME option is ON.  
        PHASE          the rest of the parameter on the command line are a
                       list of phase names
        DIR CURRENT | name    
                       set the name of the default subdirectory from which to 
                       read either collumn or taup files. 
        UNITS degrees/kilometers
                       select units of travel time curves.
                       Defaults to kilometers.
        HEADER         count set number of lines to skip at the beginning of
                       the file of collumn data.
        CONTENT string see below.
        filelist       define a new list of files of collumn data (or add to
                       old filelist).
                       The maximum number of rows in a file is 500.
        TAUP           reads the output of taup_curve
        filename       name of a file which is in the format of the output
                       of taup_curve.

DESCRIPTION
This command reads travel-times from file or computes them from a pre-specified model.  
The resulting travel time curves can be plotted on top of a record section plot 
using the PLOTRECORDSECTION command.  
Currently the only model supported is the 1991 iaspei model.  
The second listed syntax (which reads collumn data) take an optional parameter:
CONTENT.  

The content field is used to determine how to interperet each collumn.
Each specific character in the content string represents a data element
and the order of these characters mimics the order of the data in each
line of the file.  The meanings of the allowed characters in the content
field are given below:

T = Next collumn is time in seconds (dependent variable).

D = Next collumn is distance (units specified by the UNITS option)
    (independent variable).

N = Next collumn is time in seconds.

P = Next pair of entries belong to D and T data sets.

R = Next pair of entries belong to T and D data sets.

I = Ignore (skip) this data element.

An optional repetition count may follow any of the above characters.  This
repetition count is a one or two digit integer and has the same meaning as
repeating the content character that number of times.  A period (``.'') is an
infinite repetition count and means use the last characters meaning to decode
the remaining data elements in the line.  The period can only appear at the
end of a content field.

Note:  a given collumn data file can only have one distance collumn read.
