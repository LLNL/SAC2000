SYNTAX:
UNSETBB ALL | variable ...

INPUT:
      ALL  :  Unset all of the currently defined blackboard variables.

DESCRIPTION:
      The blackboard is a place to temporarily store information.  Blackboard
variables are defined using the SETBB and EVALUATE commands.  They can be
accessed by the GETBB command or used directly in a command by preceeding the
name of the variable with a percent sign ("%".) This command allows you to
unset previously defined blackboard variables.  You may unset all variables or
only a named subset.

EXAMPLES:
To unset several blackboard variables at once:
 
      u:  UNSETBB C1 C2 X
 
To unset all blackboard variables:
 
      u:  UNSETBB ALL
