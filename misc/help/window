SUMMARY:
Sets the location and shape of graphics windows.

SYNTAX:
WINDOW n {XSIZE xwmin xwmax} {YSIZE ywmin ywmax}

INPUT:
      n  :  The graphics window number of interest.  There are a total of five
          graphics windows.  

      X xwmin xwmax  :  Set the x (horizontal) location of graphics window n
          on the screen.  xwmin is the location of the left edge of the window
           and xwmax is the location of the right edge.  The range of these
          screen coordinates is 0.0 to 1.0.  

      Y ywmin ywmax  :  Set the y (vertical) location of graphics window n on
          the screen.  ywmin is the location of the bottom edge of the window
           and ywmax is the location of the top edge.  The range of these
          screen coordinates is 0.0 to 1.0.

DESCRIPTION:
      Many of the newer graphics terminals and workstations support the
concept of multiple "windows".  Different jobs or activities can run in each
window and display their results on the screen at the same time.  "X-windows"
and "Sun windows" are two of the more popular systems currently available. 
If you are using a device that supports one of these systems, then you can
use multiple graphics windows in SAC to display your results.  If you are not
using such a device, SAC will accept but ignore all commands that refer to
multiple graphics windows.
      There are two commands that control the use of this multi-windowing
option.  The WINDOW command lets you control the location and shape of the
graphics windows.  The BEGINWINDOW command lets you select the window in which
to display subsequent plots.  BEGINWINDOW will create the requested window if
it does not currently exist on your display.  The WINDOW command only works
BEFORE the window is created.  On most systems you can also move and resize
these windows dynamically using the mouse and pop-up menus.  Generally but not
always (you should check for yourself), the moving of a window will result in
the current plot being automatically redrawn whereas the resizing of a window
results in the current plot being redrawn but not rescaled.  The next plot in
a resized window will be scaled correctly.

EXAMPLES:
To set the y (vertical) location of window 3 without modifying the x 
(horizontal) location:
 
      u:  WINDOW 3 Y 0.1 0.9
