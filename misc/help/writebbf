DESCRIPTION:
This command lets you write a blackboard variable file to disk.  It can later
be read into SAC using the READBBF command.  This feature lets you save
information from one execution of SAC to another.  You can also add coding to
your own programs to access the information in these blackboard variable
files.  This lets you transfer information between your own programs and SAC.
See the SAC Subroutines Reference Manual for details.
