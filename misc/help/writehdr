SUMMARY:
Overwrites the headers on disk with those in memory.

SYNTAX:
WRITEHDR {COMMIT|ROLLBACK|RECALLTRACE}

INPUT:
      COMMIT  :  Commits headers and waveforms in SAC memory -- removing any
                 previous versions of headers or waveforms from RAM -- prior
                 to writing files.  COMMIT is the default.

      ROLLBACK  :  reverts to the last committed version of the header and
                   waveform before writing files.

      RECALLTRACE  :
		- reverts to the last committed version of the waveform,
                - reverts to the last committed version of those header
                  variables closely linked to the waveform,
                - commits those header variables which are loosely linked
                  to the waveform.
                (use HELP RECALLTRACE for a list of which header variables are
                committed, and which are rolled back.)

DEFAULT VALUES:
WRITEHDR COMMIT

DESCRIPTION:
The data on disk is NOT overwritten by this command.  Use the WRITE OVER
command to overwrite headers and data.  The WRITEHDR command should NEVER be
used if the CUT option is on.  The header in memory is modified to reflect the
effects of the CUT, but the data on disk is not modified.  Use of the WRITEHDR
command on cut data files will  have the effect of apparently shifting and
truncating the data on disk in time.

ERROR MESSAGES:
1301: No data files read in.


HEADER CHANGES:
Updates headers on disk.

LIMITATIONS:
See description above about use of CUT and WRITEHDR.

SEE COMMANDS:
CUT, WRITE, COMMIT, ROLLBACK, RECALLTRACE
