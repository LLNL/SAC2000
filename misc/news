-----------------------------

0) Our web pages have been completely re-written, and are available 
   at http://www.llnl.gov/sac

   The set of functions which handles the CSS data buffers has been completely
   overhauled to impose better consistency with the CSS 3.0 data format.
   The data now flows more smoothly between the SAC data buffer and the 
   CSS data buffer.  This solves many annoying little bugs.  In order to
   maintain flexibility, the command PICKPREFS has been added to allow
   the user more control over the way arrivals are read from the relational
   formats (database, CSS flat files, GSE, and SUDS), use HELP PICKPREFS. 
   Also the TRUST option has been added to most Reads to give the user some
   control in determining how event information is associated with waveform
   data in the relational formats, use HELP READ.  

1) New Capabilities / Added Commands and Options

  *** IMPORTANT ***
   All commands that load data into memory (funcgen, datagen, any form of
   read, etc.) have been modified to better handle the internal conversion
   between the SAC and CSS data formats.  For details, use the HELP READ.
   This is especially important for people who use CSS format regularly and
   require internal data consistency.  

  *** IMPORTANT ***
   PICKPREFS is a new command giving the user control over whether or not to
   pass CSS arrivals through the pick preferences file on its way to the 
   SAC data buffer.  The behavior established by the use or neglect of this
   command could affect all pick processing.  Type HELP PICKPREFS at the SAC>
   prompt.

   TRAVELTIME TAUP:  TRAVELTIME now takes the TAUP option, specifying that the
   named file is of the format output by taup_curve:  a traveltime estimator
   by Philip Crotwell at the University of South Carolina.
   The PICKS option saves requested picks in specified header fields T0-T9.
   Use HELP TRAVELTIME for details.

   TRANSFER now can read response information from a Frequency/Amplitude/Phase
   (FAP) file.  Also, the DBASE option sends SAC searching the Oracle database
   for pertinent EVALRESP, FAP, or POLEZERO files for instrument response.
*** IMPORTANT ***
   In versions 0.58 and 0.58a-0.58e, TRANSFER had an inconsistency in the
   units of the return values (meter vs. nm).  In version 0.59 all values
   are returned in nm (or nm/sec, or nm/sec/sec, etc.) except in cases
   where the data is transfered to a specific instrument which uses
   alternate units.  The NANO option in v0.58 is no longer available in
   v0.59.  For details use HELP TRANSFER.

   WHITEN FILTERDESIGN:  WHITEN (or PREWHITEN) uses a linear prediction filter
   to add noise to a signal to make the signal more robust under certain
   transformations.  The FILTERDESIGN option performs something similar to the 
   FILTERDESIGN command, it produces SAC files of the impulse response, the 
   amplitude & frequency responses, and the group delay of the linear
   prediction filter used in WHITEN.  For details, use HELP WHITEN.
   
   WRITE SEGY writes files to the IRIS/PASSCAL form of the SEGY format.  
   Each file contains one waveform.  Use HELP WRITE for details.  

2) Important Changes
   READ SEGY has been updated to convert more header fields to the SAC format,
   and has been modified to work more seemlessly with WRITE SEGY.  For
   details, use HELP READ.

   MAP now allows the user to add station anotations, topography and bathymetry
   to their maps.  Use HELP MAP.

   RTREND now saves slope, y intercept, standard deviation, and correlation 
   coeficient information in blackboard variables.  For details, use
   HELP RTREND.

3) Bug Fixes
   Documentation for the BBFK command has been modified for accuracy and
   clarity.  Use HELP BBFK.

   Numerous bugs have been fixed in the TRANSFER command since version 0.58.

   For those with CSS 3.0 formatted Oracle database, many bug fixes have been
   implemented in the READDB command.

| sac2000 v0.58
-----------------------------

0) Our New Area Code is 925

1) New Capabilities / Added Commands
   READCSS and WRITECSS have been rewritten from the ground up to provide
   complete CSS 3.0 compatibility.
   For details use HELP READCSS and HELP WRITECSS.

   COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and RECALLTRACE (RECALL for short) are three new commands
   which add flexibility to the process of analyzing data.  SAC now has two
   data storage locations in RAM, the original working memory that SAC has
   always had, and an I/O buffer.  After reading a set of files (which puts
   identical information in both working memory and the I/O buffer), the user
   can process the files in working memory while leaving the I/O buffer
   untouched.  The two locations contain information from the same files, but
   the one is processed and the other is not.  The user can choose from the
   following options:
	- ROLLBACK copies the unprocessed files from the I/O buffer to
	  working memory, reverting to the previous state,
	- COMMIT copies the processed files from working memory into the 
	  I/O buffer, commiting the changes in both locations,
	- RECALLTRACE rolls back the waveform certain header fields which are
	  tightly linked to the waveform, while commiting the remaining
	  header fields; the user can filter a file, use PPK to get picks, and
	  use RECALLTRACE to get the original waveform back but keep the picks.
   For more information use HELP COMMIT, HELP ROLLBACK, and HELP RECALLTRACE.

   SORT allows the user to sort the files in memory according to the header
   fields.  It can sort in ascending or decending order, and can sort on as
   many as five header fields at once.  For details, use HELP SORT.

   CUTIM allows the user to cut the file in memory.  Also allows the user to
   cut multiple segments of a file into multiple files.  For details use 
   HELP CUTIM.

   READGSE and READSUDS were added to read the GSE2.0 data format, and the SUDS
   data format.  For details use HELP READGSE and HELP READSUDS.

   WRITEGSE now writes data in the GSE2.0 format. For details use HELP WRITEGSE

   READ now take a SEGY option allowing it to read segy files of the type
   supported by IRIS/PASSCAL.  For details use HELP READ.

   READ now takes an ALPHA option to allow it to read SAC formated alphanumeric
   files such as those written with WRITE ALPHA.  To avoid some of the 
   confusion, the READALPHA command (which doesn't read SAC formated 
   alphanumeric files, but tabular collumn data) has been renamed READTABLE 
   (or RTAB for short).  For details, use HELP READ or HELP READTABLE.

   WHITE (or PREWHITE) has been added as a command callable from either SAC's
   main shell, or from the SPE subprocess.  It performs the same processing as
   the PREWHITEN option of the COR command.  Use HELP WHITEN for details.  

   FILTERDESIGN is working again. FILTERDESIGN plots a graphical representation
   of a filter, the parameters of which are entered by the user at the command
   line.  
   The FILE option saves Impulse Response, Group Delay, and Amplitude and Phase
   information in SAC files.  Use HELP FILTERDESIGN for details.  

   PRINT option has been added to the following commands:  BEGINFRAME, PLOT,
   PLOT1, PLOT2, BBFK, FILTERDESIGN, PLOTALPHA, PLOTCOR, PLOTDY, PLOTPM,
   PLOTRECORDSECTION, IMAGE, SONOGRAM, and SPECTROGRAM.  When
   used with the BEGINFRAME command, it signals the ENDFRAME command to print
   the resultant plot.  All other commands simply print the resultant plot.  
   It optionally takes the name of a printer as a parameter.  It will write
   SGF files in the /tmp directory.  Use the HELP command on any of the listed
   commands for details.

   PRINT command will print the most recent SGF file produced.  This presumes 
   an SGF file has been produced since SAC2000 was booted.  For details use
   HELP PRINT.

   The SGF command now takes an OVERWRITE option.  When OVERWRITE is on, each
   SGF file written overwrites the previous SGF file.  This saves space on the
   hard disk, but the files disappear.  

   PRINTHELP hardcopies of help files.  Use HELP PRINTHELP for details.
   
2) Important Changes
   The maximum number of files that can be read into SAC2000 has been
   increased from 200 to 1000.  

   Now that there are two memory locations where each file is stored, it is 
   important for certain SAC commands, that the two copies of each file
   be identical.  For this reason, the following commands will automatically
   perform either a COMMIT, ROLLBACK, or RECALLTRACE before executing:
   MERGE
   DATAGEN MORE
   READ MORE
   READTABLE MORE (formerly READALPHA)
   READCSS MORE
   READDB MORE
   READGSE MORE
   READHDR MORE
   READSDD MORE
   READSUDS MORE
   SORT
   WRITE
   WRITECSS
   WRITEHDR
   WRITESP
   WRITESTACK
   In each case, COMMIT is the default, but options allow the user to change to
   ROLLBACK or RECALLTRACE.  Use the HELP command for further information.  

   The commands MULF, DIVF, ADDF, and SUBF have -- in previous versions -- left
   the user with the headers from the file being added (or what have you) in,
   as opposed to keeping the original header.  This version and future versions
   will keep the original header by default.  An option has been provided to
   allow the user to keep the new header instead.  For details use HELP MULF,
   HELP DIVF, HELP ADDF, or HELP SUBF.

   DELETECHANNEL now accepts a range of filenumbers using the dash (-).
   For details, use HELP DELETECHANNEL.

   The MERGE command has been updated to allow files with overlapping data 
   points to merge as long as the overlapping points line up exactly.  

   PLOT2 now plots spectral files (IRLIM and IAMPH) as relative whether the
   RELATIVE or ABSOLUTE option is selected.  This is because frequency is
   not measured on an arbitrary scale as is time.  For details use HELP PLOT2.

   sacio.a is a new library available on our ftp site which a whole lot smaller
   than sac.a and allows full use of all the SAC I/O routines written up in the
   SAC manual.  These routines can be called transparently from either C or 
   FORTRAN code.  Use HELP INPUT_OUTPUT and HELP APPENDIX for details.  

3) Bug Fixes
   Modified SPE subprocess to allow windows greater than 2048.

   Fixed a bug in e1 compressed data expansion

   Fixed a bug that prevented SAC from reading from links.

-----------------------------
| sac2000 v0.57
-----------------------------

0) New Area Code
   On March 14, 1998, the area code for Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,
   and the SAC developement team, changed from 510 to 925.  Mandatory dialing 
   of the new area code begins September 12.

1) New Capabilities / Added Commands
   READDB gets data from an Oracle database.  Note that this capability is only
   available on the Sun/Solaris version of SAC2000.  To get READDB working, 
   the executable sac2000.57.oracle.Z, must be downloaded from the ftp site
   and uncompressed (see the README file which came with the distribution).  
   The user also needs access to a compatibly formatted Oracle database.  
   For details on how the command works, use HELP READDB.
     A note to the Oracle database manager:  The READDB command will work with
     a database that strictly conforms to the CSS 3.0 data format.  
     Alternatively, if an EVID column is added (and populated) in the WFDISC
     table, READDB will work, and have increased performance for some queries.

2) Bug Fixes
   Fixed bug in p2 which prevented fileid from plotting properly if it was
   set to a header variable.  

   Fixed bug in central plotting routine which was plotting data points off
   the right side of the plot.

   The DC abbreviation had been overloaded, refering to the DELETECHANNEL 
   command in the main part of SAC2000 and to the DELTACHECK command in the 
   Seismogram Stacking Subprocess.  DC no longer refers to the DELTACHECK
   command.  Users wishing to use the DELTACHECK command in SSS should
   spell out the whole command name.  

   Fixed a bug in SPECTROGRAM which was producing errors in header fields.

   Fixed a bug in 3c which didn't update SAC data in MATLAB when the engine
   was left running between calls.

-----------------------------
| sac2000 v0.56a
-----------------------------
1) The sac I/O library routines have been rewritten and are included in the 
   SAC library called sac.a.  sac.a is available on the SAC2000 ftp site.  
   Now there is one set of I/O routines which can be called from either C or
   FORTRAN programs.  See help input_output, help blackboard, and help appendix.

-----------------------------
| sac2000 v0.56 and prior
-----------------------------

1) New Capabilities

 READCSS does a more comprehensive job of reading CSS 3.0 flat files.
 see help readcss

 READCSS can handle the e1 compressed format.

 SAC has a MATLAB interface, allowing users with MATLAB to use its 
 capabilities within SAC.  See help mat.  

 3C is a new three-component processing capability in SAC2000.  
 It allows the user to interactively estimate a signals polarization 
 and wave type (P or S).  It can also be run in batch mode.  
 See help 3c 

 Users who don't have MATLAB, can still use SAC.

 The external function capability, which allows users to design their 
 own sac commands, has been enhanced and we have included an example 
 external function called flipxy with the distribution.  This function 
 allows the users to transpose XY data, and provides an example to the user of
 how to write and install an external command into SAC.

 WIENER now checks to make sure that the noise window is within the data window.


2) Added Commands
 DELETECHANNEL (DC) removes a file from SAC's memory.  see help deletechannel

 FILENUMBER (FN) allows the plots to display the file number of each file.  
 This can be used to determine the number of a file to be deleted with
 DELETECHANNEL.  see help filenumber.

 DELETESTACK performs the same function as DELETECHANNEL, but it can be called
 from within the Signal Stacking Subprocess (SSS).  

 PICKAUTHOR and PICKPHASE are used to modify the behavior READCSS uses in 
 reading picks from the .arrival file (CSS 3.0 flat files).  
 see help readcss, help pickauthor, and help pickphase


3) Added Options
 BB option for TRAVELTIME command saves a time on the black board.
 see help traveltime

 If the DISTANCEWINDOW command is called with two real numbers, it will behave
 as though the FIXED option is specified.

 The utility SGFPLOT can take the CONSTRAIN option which constrains the aspect
 ratio of the plot to 3/4 (Thanks to Arthur Snoke).


4) Bug Fixes
 A bug in TRAVELTIME prevented traveltime curves in ascii files from plotting
 correctly in portrait mode.  This has been corrected.  see help traveltime

 SYNCHRONIZE was synchronizing files properly only if they had the same date.  
 Files with different dates were having the begintimes all set to zero.  This 
 has been corrected.  For the user who wants the begin times set to zero, the
 BEGIN option has been added to this command.  see help SYNCHRONIZE

 A bug prevented users who had changed the color table to return to the default
 color table (table 17).  This has been corrected.  see help loadctable

 The PLOT1 command would not utilize the relative option if XLIM was set.  This
 has been corrected.

 The CUT command now cuts precisely where the user requests.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Recent developments in and enhancements to SAC2000 (v55 and prior) |
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A number of new features, recent developments or improvements 
are briefly summarized below.  For the most up-to-date information 
on specific commands consult the on-line documentation.  
Additional information can also be found on our web page at 
http://www-ep.es.llnl.gov/tvp/sac.html

One of our recent developments is an interface to matlab that will 
allow you to run matlab scripts from within SAC2000 on data in 
memory.  Our matlab interface currently provides direct access 
to sac waveform data and all relevant header fields.  
Development of this interface is still in progress.  In our next release, 
the header will be broken into well defined structures for easier 
access and we are also considering adding access to SAC2000's blackboard. 
For more information on this feature type "help mat" inside 
SAC2000.  

Another useful feature that many of our long-time users may 
not be aware of is our interface to the Generic Mapping Tools 
(GMT) codes which allows the user to make quick maps of stations, 
and events, where the event symbols can be scaled by magnitude 
or residual.  

Users can also develop their own sac commands based on 
standalone C or FORTRAN programs.  These commands run within 
SAC2000 sharing waveform and header data in SAC2000's internal memory.  
For more information type help "external_interface"

Our spectrogram/sonogram commands are also a popular feature.  
These commands produce properly registered high resolution 
color spectrograms and binary sonograms, 


*** The following is a very brief summary of some ***
*** of the recent developments/improvements.      ***
***            Commands are in all caps.          ***
