 *
 *	g2tofloat - convert g2 format data to host single precision
 *
 * SYNOPSIS
 *
 *	g2tofloat (from, to, num)
 *	unsigned char	*from;		(i) array with gainranged data
 *	float		*to;		(o) degained data
 *	int		num;		(i) number of entries
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *	G2 format provides a representation with a manitissa ranging
 *	from -8192 to +8192 (8191 is the BIAS) and a multiplier of 1,
 *	4, 16, or 128 (the multiplier is 128/<gain-code>).
 *	Although the total dynamic range is +- 2**20,
 *	many numbers within this range are not representable.
 *
 *	To avoid the difficulty of having a vax and ieee versions of
 *	the g2 format, we define the g2 format as a byte stream.  Each
 *	value takes two bytes (bytes are 8 bits) with the high order
 *	two bits of byte[0] being the gain code, the low order 6 bits
 *	and the 8 bits of the second byte being the value (the 6 bits
 *	are the high order bits in the 14 bit value).
 *
 *	If value is less than BIAS, it is a negative number, if it is
 *	greater than BIAS it is a positive number.
 *
 *	Bit 15 and 16 (two upper bits) of the first byte in each
 *	sample contains the gain ranging value which determines the gain code:
 *
 *	00 -> gain code	= 128
 *	01 -> gain code 	= 32
 *	10 -> gain code  	= 8
 *	11 -> gain code  	= 1
 *
 *	The formula for g2 to integer is:
 *	(value-BIAS)*(128/<gain code>).
 * NOTES
 *	These routines can be used as inplace conversions.
 *
 *	Although g2 format offers less precision then integer format,
 *	in practice there is no difference since the original data from
 *	NORSAR is recorded in g2 format.  In other words, we have already
 *	lost the precision before the data reaches the processing stage.
