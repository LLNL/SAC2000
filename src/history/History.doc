*********************** Changes to SAC to use a history list *******************


changes to sac.c:
#include "../../inc/history.h"
strcpy(kmsg,AddToHistory(kmsg);

Created the file history.h and added it to $SACDIR/inc


Created the directory history under $SACDIR/src. This contains the source
file history.c which implements the history command. The remaining 
documentation for history is in history.c

Created a makefile for history.
